//   absence of a given hotkey can sometimes impact whether other hotkeys need to be converted from
//   HK_NORMAL to HK_KEYBD_HOOK.  For example, a newly added/enabled global hotkey variant can
//   cause a HK_KEYBD_HOOK hotkey to become HK_NORMAL, and the converse is also true.
// - Based on the above, decide whether the keyboard and/or mouse hooks need to be (de)activated.
