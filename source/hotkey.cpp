		// mNoSuppress: They're supported as normal (non-tilde) hotkeys as long as RegisterHotkey succeeds.
		// mAllowExtraModifiers: v1.0.42: The hotkey is registered along with any explicit modifiers it might have
		//     (the wildcard part is ignored).  In prior versions, wildcard hotkeys were disabled, and so were
		//     any non-wildcard suffixes they "eclipsed" (e.g. *^a would eclipse/disable ^!a).  Both cases are
		//     now enabled in v1.0.42.
		// mModifiersLR: v1.0.42: In older versions, such hotkeys were wrongly registered without any modifiers
		//     at all.  For example, <#x would be registered simply as "x".  To correct this, it seemed best
		//     to convert left/right modifiers (include lwin/rwin since RegisterHotkey requires the neutral "Win")
		//     to their neutral counterparts so that an attempt can be made to register them.  This step is done
		//     in the code section above.
		// mModifierVK or SC: Always set to use the hook so that they're disabled on Win9x, which seems best because
		//     there's no way to even get close to full functionality on Win9x.
		// mVK && vk_to_sc(mVK, true): Its mVK corresponds to two scan codes, which would requires the hook
		//     (except Win9x). The hook is required because when the hook receives a NumpadEnter keystroke
		//     (regardless of whether NumpadEnter itself is also a hotkey), it will look up that scan code
		//     and see that it always and unconditionally takes precedence over its VK, and thus the VK is ignored.
		//     If that scan code has no hotkey, nothing happens (i.e. pressing NumpadEnter doesn't fire an Enter::
		//     hotkey; it does nothing at all unless NumpadEnter:: is also a hotkey).  By contrast, if Enter
		//     became a registered hotkey vs. hook, it would fire for both Enter and NumpadEnter unless the script
		//     happened to have a NumpadEnter hotkey also (which we don't check due to rarity).
		// aHookAction: In versions older than 1.0.42, most of these were disabled just because they happened
		//     to be mModifierVK/SC hotkeys, which are always flagged as hook and thus disabled in Win9x.
		//     However, ones that were implemented as <#x rather than "LWin & x" were inappropriately enabled.
		//     as a naked/unmodified "x" hotkey (due to mModifiersLR paragraph above, and the fact that
		//     aHookAction hotkeys really should be explicitly disabled since they can't function on Win9x.
		//     This disabling-by-setting-to-type-hook is now ALSO done in ManifestAllHotkeysHotstringsHooks() because
		//     the hotkey command is capable of changing a hotkey to/from the alt-tab type.
		// mKeyUp: Disabled as an unintended/benevolent side-effect of older loop processing in
		//     ManifestAllHotkeysHotstringsHooks().  This is retained, though now it's made more explicit via below,
		//     for maintainability.
		// Older Note: Do this for both AT_LEAST_ONE_VARIANT_HAS_TILDE and NO_SUPPRESS_PREFIX.  In the case of
