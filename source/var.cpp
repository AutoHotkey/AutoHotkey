	// realized by omitting the synthesized formats from the saved version). One thing that
	// is certain is that the "real" format(s) come first and the synthesized ones afterward.
	// However, that's not quite enough because although it is recommended that apps store
	// the primary/preferred format first, the OS does not enforce this.  For example, testing
	// shows that the apps do not have to store CF_UNICODETEXT prior to storing CF_TEXT,
	// in which case the clipboard might have inaccurate CF_TEXT as the first element and
	// more accurate/complete (non-synthesized) CF_UNICODETEXT stored as the next.
	// In spite of the above, the below seems likely to be accurate 99% or more of the time,
	// which seems worth it given the large savings of memory that are achieved, especially
	// for large quantities of text or large images. Confidence is further raised by the
	// fact that MSDN says there's no advantage/reason for an app to place multiple formats
	// onto the clipboard if those formats are available through synthesis.
	// And since CF_TEXT always(?) yields synthetic CF_OEMTEXT and CF_UNICODETEXT, and
	// probably (but less certainly) vice versa: if CF_TEXT is listed first, it might certainly
	// mean that the other two do not need to be stored.  There is some slight doubt about this
	// in a situation where an app explicitly put CF_TEXT onto the clipboard and then followed
	// it with CF_UNICODETEXT that isn't synthesized, nor does it match what would have been
	// synthesized. However, that seems extremely unlikely (it would be much more likely for
	// an app to store CF_UNICODETEXT *first* followed by custom/non-synthesized CF_TEXT, but
	// even that might be unheard of in practice).  So for now -- since there is no documentation
	// to be found about this anywhere -- it seems best to omit some of the most common
	// synthesized formats:
	// CF_TEXT is the first of three text formats to appear: Omit CF_OEMTEXT and CF_UNICODETEXT.
	//    (but not vice versa since those are less certain to be synthesized)
	//    (above avoids using four times the amount of memory that would otherwise be required)
	//    UPDATE: Only the first text format is included now, since MSDN says there is no
	//    advantage/reason to having multiple non-synthesized text formats on the clipboard.
	// CF_DIB: Always omit this if CF_DIBV5 is available (which must be present on Win2k+, at least
	// as a synthesized format, whenever CF_DIB is present?) This policy seems likely to avoid
	// the issue where CF_DIB occurs first yet CF_DIBV5 that comes later is *not* synthesized,
	// perhaps simply because the app stored DIB prior to DIBV5 by mistake (though there is
	// nothing mandatory, so maybe it's not really a mistake). Note: CF_DIBV5 supports alpha
	// channel / transparency, and perhaps other things, and it is likely that when synthesized,
	// no information of the original CF_DIB is lost. Thus, when CF_DIBV5 is placed back onto
	// the clipboard, any app that needs CF_DIB will have it synthesized back to the original
	// data (hopefully). It's debatable whether to do it that way or store whichever comes first
	// under the theory that an app would never store both formats on the clipboard since MSDN

		// But since this loss occurs at most once per distinct variable name,
		// it's not considered a memory leak because the loss can't exceed a fixed
		// amount regardless of how long the program runs.  The reason for all of this
		// is that allocating dynamic memory is costly: it causes system memory fragmentation,
		// (especially if a var were to be malloc'd and free'd thousands of times in a loop)
		// and small-sized mallocs have a large overhead: it's been said that every block
		// of dynamic mem, even those of size 1 or 2, incurs about 40 bytes of overhead
		// (and testing of SimpleHeap supports this).
		// UPDATE: Yes it's true that a script could create an unlimited number of new variables
		// by constantly using different dynamic names when creating them.  But it's still supportable
		// that there's no memory leak because even if the worst-case series of events mentioned
		// higher above occurs for every variable, only a fixed amount of memory is ever lost per
		// variable.  So you could think of the lost memory as part of the basic overhead of creating
		// a variable (since variables are never truly destroyed, just their contents freed).
