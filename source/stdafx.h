#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE // Avoid compiler warnings in VC++ 8.x/2005 that urge the use of lower-performing C library functions that protect against buffer overruns.
#define _CRT_NON_CONFORMING_SWPRINTFS // We don't want ISO version of swprintf, which has similar interface with snwprintf (different from sprintf)
#define WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN		 // Exclude rarely-used stuff from Windows headers
#define _WINSOCK_DEPRECATED_NO_WARNINGS // Primarily for WSAAsyncSelect, since the recommended replacement is inadequate.

// Windows Header Files:
// Necessary to do this prior to including windows.h so that NT functions are unlocked:
// UPDATE: Using 0x0500 now so that VK_XBUTTON1 and 2 can be supported:
// UPDATE v1.0.36.03: Using 0x0501 now so that various ListView constants and other things can be used.
// UPDATE v1.0.36.05: 0x0501 broke the Tooltip cmd on on Win9x/NT4/2000 by increasing the size of the TOOLINFO
// struct by 4 bytes.  However, rather than forever go without 0x501 and the many upgrades and constants
// it makes available in the code, it seems best to stick with it and instead patch anything that needs it
// (such as ToolTip).  Hopefully, ToolTip is the only thing in the current code base that needs patching
// (perhaps the only reason it was broken in the first place was a bug or oversight by MS).
// UPDATE v1.1.10.00: Using 0x0600 for Vista/7/8's audio APIs.
// UPDATE v1.1.10.01: Using 0x0600 broke Process Close and who knows what else on Win XP.
// Instead, use 0x0501 and redefine it to 0x0600 only for the specific APIs which we need.
#define _WIN32_WINNT 0x0501
//#define _WIN32_IE 0x0501  // Added for v1.0.35 to have MCS_NOTODAY resolve as expected, and possibly solve other problems on newer systems.
#define _WIN32_IE _WIN32_IE_IE70  // Added for TVN_ITEMCHANGED, which most likely requires Vista.
