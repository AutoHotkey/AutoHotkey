// This macro is used to Sleep without the possibility of a new hotkey subroutine being launched.
// Timed subroutines will also be prevented from running while it is enabled.
// It should be used when an operation needs to sleep, but doesn't want to be interrupted (suspended)
// by any hotkeys the user might press during that time.  Reasons why the caller wouldn't want to
// be suspended:
// 1) If it's doing something with a window -- such as sending keys or clicking the mouse or trying
//    to activate it -- that might get messed up if a new hotkey fires in the middle of the operation.
// 2) If its a command that's still using some of its parameters that might reside in the deref buffer.
//    In this case, the launching of a new hotkey would likely overwrite those values, causing
//    unpredictable behavior.
