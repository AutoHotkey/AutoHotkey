UINT StrReplace(LPTSTR aHaystack, LPTSTR aOld, LPTSTR aNew, StringCaseSenseType aStringCaseSense
	, UINT aLimit, size_t aSizeLimit, LPTSTR *aDest, size_t *aHaystackLength)
// Replaces all (or aLimit) occurrences of aOld with aNew in aHaystack.
// On success, it returns the number of replacements done (0 if none).  On failure (out of memory), it returns 0
// (and if aDest isn't NULL, it also sets *aDest to NULL on failure).
//
// PARAMETERS:
// - aLimit: Specify UINT_MAX to have no restriction on the number of replacements.  Otherwise, specify a number >=0.
// - aSizeLimit: Specify -1 to assume that aHaystack has enough capacity for any mode #1 replacement. Otherwise,
//   specify the size limit (in either mode 1 or 2), but it must be >= length of aHaystack (simplifies the code).
// - aDest: If NULL, the function will operate in mode #1.  Otherwise, it uses mode #2 (see further below).
// - aHaystackLength: If it isn't NULL, *aHaystackLength must be the length of aHaystack.  HOWEVER, *aHaystackLength
//   is then changed here to be the length of the result string so that caller can use it to improve performance.
//
// MODE 1 (when aDest==NULL): aHaystack is used as both the source and the destination (sometimes temporary memory
// is used for performance, but it's freed afterward and so transparent to the caller).
// When it passes in -1 for aSizeLimit (the default), caller must ensure that aHaystack has enough capacity to hold
// the new/replaced result.  When non-NULL, aSizeLimit will be enforced by limiting the number of replacements to
// the available memory (i.e. any remaining replacements are simply not done and that part of haystack is unaltered).
//
// MODE 2 (when aDest!=NULL): If zero replacements are needed, we set *aDest to be aHaystack to indicate that no
// new memory was allocated.  Otherwise, we store in *aDest the address of the new memory that holds the result.
// - The caller is responsible for any new memory in *aDest (freeing it, etc.)
// - The initial value of *aDest doesn't matter.
// - The contents of aHaystack isn't altered, not even if aOld_length==aNew_length (some callers rely on this).
//
// v1.0.45: This function was heavily revised to improve performance and flexibility.  It has also made
// two other/related StrReplace() functions obsolete.  Also, the code has been simplified to avoid doing
// a first pass through haystack to find out exactly how many replacements there are because that step
// nearly doubles the time required for the entire operation (in most cases).  Its benefit was mainly in
// memory savings and avoidance of any reallocs since the initial alloc was always exactly right; however,
// testing shows that one or two reallocs are generally much quicker than doing the size-calculation phase
// because extra alloc'ing & memcpy'ing is much faster than an extra search through haystack for all the matches.
// Furthermore, the new approach minimizes reallocs by using smart prediction.  Furthermore, the caller shrinks
// the result memory via _expand() to avoid having too much extra/overhang.  These optimizations seem to make
// the new approach better than the old one in every way, but especially performance.

		// Therefore, it seems best to call the right function even though DeleteObject might work on
		// all of them on some or all current OSes.  UPDATE: Evidence indicates that DestroyIcon()
		// will also destroy cursors, probably because icons and cursors are literally identical in
		// every functional way.  One piece of evidence:
		//> No stack trace, but I know the exact source file and line where the call

		// Otherwise, resource usage would cascade upward until the script finally terminated, at
