	// - Interrupt timeout is 60 seconds (or 60 milliseconds for that matter).
	// - For some reason IsInterrupt() isn't called for 24+ hours even though there is a current/active thread.
	// - RefreshInterruptibility() fires at 23 hours and marks the thread interruptible.
	// - Sometime after that, one of the following happens:
	//      Computer is suspended/hibernated and stays that way for 50+ days.
	//      IsInterrupt() is never called (except by RefreshInterruptibility()) for 50+ days.
	//      (above is currently unlikely because MSG_FILTER_MAX calls IsInterruptible())

		//    in case the user launches by pressing ENTER on a script, for example, and then immediately
		//    tries to use a hotkey.  In addition, we want any timed subroutines to start running ASAP
		//    because in rare cases the user might rely upon that happening.
		// 2) To support the case when the auto-execute section never finishes (such as when it contains
		//    an infinite loop to do background processing), yet we still want to allow the script
		//    to put custom defaults into effect globally (for things such as KeyDelay).
		// Obviously, the above approach has its flaws; there are ways to construct a script that would
		// result in unexpected behavior.  However, the combination of this approach with the fact that
		// the global defaults are updated *again* when/if the auto-execute section finally completes
		// raises the expectation of proper behavior to a very high level.  In any case, I'm not sure there
		// is any better approach that wouldn't break existing scripts or require a redesign of some kind.
		// If this method proves unreliable due to disk activity slowing the program down to a crawl during
		// the critical milliseconds after launch, one thing that might fix that is to have ExecUntil()
		// be forced to run a minimum of, say, 100 lines (if there are that many) before allowing the
		// timer expiration to have its effect.  But that's getting complicated and I'd rather not do it
		// unless someone actually reports that such a thing ever happens.  Still, to reduce the chance

	// The below is done even if AutoExecSectionTimeout() already set the values once.
	// This is because when the AutoExecute section finally does finish, by definition it's
	// supposed to store the global settings that are currently in effect as the default values.
	// In other words, the only purpose of AutoExecSectionTimeout() is to handle cases where
	// the AutoExecute section takes a long time to complete, or never completes (perhaps because
	// it is being used by the script as a "background thread" of sorts):
	// Save the values of KeyDelay, WinDelay etc. in case they were changed by the auto-execute part

	// is launched.  Each launched subroutine may then change the values for its own purposes without
	// affecting the settings for other subroutines:
	global_clear_state(*g);  // Start with a "clean slate" in both g_default and g (in case things like InitNewThread() check some of the values in g prior to launching a new thread).

	// Always want g_default.AllowInterruption==true so that InitNewThread()  doesn't have to
	// set it except when Critical or "Thread Interrupt" require it.  If the auto-execute section ended
	// without anyone needing to call IsInterruptible() on it, AllowInterruption could be false
	// even when Critical is off.
	// Even if the still-running AutoExec section has turned on Critical, the assignment below is still okay
	// because InitNewThread() adjusts AllowInterruption based on the value of ThreadIsCritical.
	// See similar code in AutoExecSectionTimeout().
	g->AllowThreadToBeInterrupted = true; // Mostly for the g_default line below. See comments above.
	CopyMemory(&g_default, g, sizeof(global_struct)); // g->IsPaused has been set to false higher above in case it's ever possible that it's true as a result of AutoExecSection().
	// After this point, the values in g_default should never be changed.
	global_maximize_interruptibility(*g); // See below.
	// Now that any changes made by the AutoExec section have been saved to g_default (including
	// the commands Critical and Thread), ensure that the very first g-item is always interruptible.
	// This avoids having to treat the first g-item as special in various places.

	// It seems best to set ErrorLevel to NONE after the auto-execute part of the script is done.
	// However, it isn't set to NONE right before launching each new thread (e.g. hotkey subroutine)
	// because it's more flexible that way (i.e. the user may want one hotkey subroutine to use the value
	// of ErrorLevel set by another).  This reset was also done by LoadFromFile(), but it is done again
	// here in case the auto-execute section changed it:

	// LAZY LIST: Although it's not nearly as good as hashing (which might be implemented in the future,

	// DETAILS:
	// The fact that this merge operation is so much faster than total work required
	// to insert each one into the main list is the whole reason for having the lazy
	// list.  In other words, the large memmove() that would otherwise be required
	// to insert each new variable into the main list is completely avoided.  Large memmove()s
	// become dramatically more costly than small ones because apparently they can't fit into
	// the CPU cache, so the operation would take hundreds or even thousands of times longer
	// depending on the speed difference between main memory and CPU cache.  But above and
	// beyond the CPU cache issue, the lazy sorting method results in vastly less memory
	// being moved than would have been required without it, so even if the CPU doesn't have
	// a cache, the lazy list method vastly increases performance for scripts that have more
	// than 100,000 variables, allowing at least 5 million variables to be created without a
	// dramatic reduction in performance.

				// NOTE 1: v1.0.46: The IS_ASSIGNMENT_EXCEPT_POST_AND_PRE line above was added in conjunction with
				// the new assignment operators (e.g. := and +=). Here's what it does: Normally, the assignment
				// operators have the lowest precedence of all (except for commas) because things that lie
				// to the *right* of them in the infix expression should be evaluated first to be stored
				// as the assignment's result.  However, if what lies to the *left* of the assignment
				// operator isn't a valid lvalue/variable (and not even a unary like -x can produce an lvalue
				// because they're not supposed to alter the contents of the variable), obeying the normal
				// precedence rules would be produce a syntax error due to "assigning to non-lvalue".
				// So instead, apply any pending operator on the stack (which lies to the left of the lvalue
				// in the infix expression) *after* the assignment by leaving it on the stack.  For example,
				// C++ and probably other languages (but not the older ANSI C) evaluate "true ? x:=1 : y:=1"
				// as a pair of assignments rather than as who-knows-what (probably a syntax error if you
				// strictly followed precedence).  Similarly, C++ evaluates "true ? var1 : var2 := 3" not as
				// "(true ? var1 : var2) := 3" (like ANSI C) but as "true ? var1 : (var2 := 3)".  Other examples:
				// -> not var:=5 ; It's evaluated contrary to precedence as: not (var:=5) [PHP does this too,
				//    and probably others]
				// -> 5 + var+=5 ; It's evaluated contrary to precedence as: 5 + (var+=5) [not sure if other
				//    languages do ones like this]
				// -> ++i := 5 ; Silly since increment has no lasting effect; so assign the 5 then do the pre-inc.
				// -> ++i /= 5 ; Valid, but maybe too obscure and inconsistent to treat it differently than
				//    the others (especially since not many people will remember that unlike i++, ++i produces
				//    an lvalue); so divide by 5 then do the increment.
				// -> i++ := 5 (and i++ /= 5) ; Postfix operator can't produce an lvalue, so do the assignment
				//    first and then the postfix op.
				// Also, SYM_FUNC seems unaffected by any of this due to its enclosing parentheses (i.e. even
				// if a function-call can someday generate an lvalue [SYM_VAR], the current rules probably
				// already support it.
				// Performance: Adding the above behavior reduced the expressions benchmark by only 0.6%; so
				// it seems worth it.
				//
				// NOTE 2: The SYM_POWER line above is a workaround to allow 2**-2 (and others in v1.0.45) to be
				// evaluated as 2**(-2) rather than being seen as an error.  However, as of v1.0.46, consecutive
				// unary operators are supported via the right-to-left evaluation flag above (formerly, consecutive
				// unaries produced a failure [blank value]).  For example:
				// !!x  ; Useful to convert a blank value into a zero for use with uninitialized variables.
				// not not x  ; Same as above.
				// Other examples: !-x, -!x, !&x, -&Var, ~&Var
				// And these deref ones (which worked even before v1.0.46 by different means: giving
				// '*' a higher precedence than the other unaries): !*Var, -*Var and ~*Var
				// !x  ; Supported even if X contains a negative number, since x is recognized as an isolated operand and not something containing unary minus.
				//
				if (IS_SHORT_CIRCUIT_OPERATOR(infix_symbol))
				{
					// Short-circuit boolean evaluation works as follows:
					//
					// When an AND/OR/IFF is encountered in infix, it is immediately put into postfix to act as a
					// unary operator on its left operand and something like a conditional jump instruction. It is
					// also pushed onto the stack so that the end of its right branch can be found in accordance with
					// precedence rules; when it is popped off the stack, circuit_token is set to the last token in
					// postfix at that point, which is necessarily the end of the operator's right branch.
					//
					// x AND y
					// x OR y
					// x IFF_THEN y IFF_ELSE z
					//
					// AND/OR: Pop operand off stack. If short-circuit condition is satified, push the operand back
					// onto the stack and jump over the operator's right branch; otherwise simply continue, allowing
					// the right branch to be evaluated and its result used as the overall result of the AND/OR.
					//
					// IFF_THEN: Pop operand off stack. If false, jump to the "else" branch; otherwise continue.
					// IFF_ELSE: Encountered only after evaluating the "then" branch; jumps over the "else" branch.
					//
					// This new approach has the following benefits over the old approach:
					// 1) circuit_token doesn't need to be checked every time a value is pushed onto the stack.
					// 2) circuit_token doesn't need to propagate from an operator or function-call to its result.
					// 3) Cascading of short-circuit operators does not need to be handled specifically
					//    as it is naturally supported via infix-to-postfix conversion.
					// 4) Since circuit_token is only needed in the actual operators, it can overlap with
					//    the value fields -- i.e. the size of ExprTokenType may be reduced (assuming
					//    the other uses of circuit_token can be eliminated).
					//
					// OBSOLETE COMMENTS:
					// To facilitate short-circuit boolean evaluation, right before an AND/OR/IFF is pushed onto the
					// stack, point the end of it's left branch to it.  Note that the following postfix token
					// can itself be of type AND/OR/IFF, a simple example of which is "if (true and true and true)",
					// in which the first and's parent (in an imaginary tree) is the second "and".
					// But how is it certain that this is the final operator or operand of and AND/OR/IFF's left branch?
					// Here is the explanation:
					// Everything higher precedence than the AND/OR/IFF came off the stack right before it, resulting in
					// what must be a balanced/complete sub-postfix-expression in and of itself (unless the expression
					// has a syntax error, which is caught in various places).  Because it's complete, during the
					// postfix evaluation phase, that sub-expression will result in a new operand for the stack,
					// which must then be the left side of the AND/OR/IFF because the right side immediately follows it
					// within the postfix array, which in turn is immediately followed its operator (namely AND/OR/IFF).
					// Also, the final result of an IFF's condition-branch must point to the IFF/THEN symbol itself
					// because that's the means by which the condition is merely "checked" rather than becoming an
					// operand itself.

		//    why calling MsgSleep(-1) does not achieve this goal, since it too does a Peek().
		//    Nevertheless, that is the testing result that was obtained: the mouse cursor lagged
		//    in tight script loops even when MsgSleep(-1) or (0) was called every 10ms or so.
		// 2) The app is maximally responsive while executing in a tight loop.
		// 3) Hotkeys are maximally responsive.  For example, if a user has game hotkeys, using
		//    a GetTickCount() method (which very slightly improves performance by cutting back on
		//    the number of Peek() calls) would introduce up to 10ms of delay before the hotkey
		//    finally takes effect.  10ms can be significant in games, where ping (latency) itself
		//    can sometimes be only 10 or 20ms. UPDATE: It looks like PeekMessage() yields CPU time
		//    automatically, similar to a Sleep(0), when our queue has no messages.  Since this would
		//    make scripts slow to a crawl, only do the Peek() every 5ms or so (though the timer
		//    granularity is 10ms on most OSes, so that's the true interval).

			// When a "return" is executed inside a loop's body (and possibly an Exit or Fail too, but those are

			// A_Index and A_LoopField to be restored for the outermost caller of ExecUntil():
			// 1) Var%A_Index% := func_that_returns_directly_from_inside_a_loop_body().

			//    caller because it had been designed to restore inter-line, not for intra-line activities like
			//    calling functions.
			// 2) A command that has expressions in two separate parameters and one of those parameters calls
			//    a function that returns directly from inside one of its loop bodies.
			//
			// This change was made feasible by making the A_LoopXXX attributes thread-specific, which prevents
			// interrupting threads from affecting the values our thread sees here.  So that change protects
			// against thread interruptions, and this backup/restore change here keeps the Loop variables in
			// sync with the current nesting level (braces, gosub, etc.)
