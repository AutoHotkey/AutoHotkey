	// critical/high-priority threads should be interrupted because there's no way easy way to buffer or
	// postpone the call.  Therefore, NO check of the following is done here:
	// - Current thread's priority (that's something of a deprecated feature anyway).
	// - Current thread's status of Critical (however, Critical would prevent us from ever being called in
	//   cases where the callback is triggered indirectly via message/dispatch due to message filtering
	//   and/or Critical's ability to pump messes less often).
	// - INTERRUPTIBLE_IN_EMERGENCY (which includes g_MenuIsVisible and g_AllowInterruption), which primarily
	//   affects SLEEP_WITHOUT_INTERRUPTION): It's debatable, but to maximize flexibility it seems best to allow
	//   callbacks during the display of a menu and during SLEEP_WITHOUT_INTERRUPTION.  For most callers of
	//   SLEEP_WITHOUT_INTERRUPTION, interruptions seem harmless.  For some it could be a problem, but when you
	//   consider how rare such callbacks are (mostly just subclassing of windows/controls) and what those
	//   callbacks tend to do, conflicts seem very rare.
	// Of course, a callback can also be triggered through explicit script action such as a DllCall of
	// EnumWindows, in which case the script would want to be interrupted unconditionally to make the call.
	// However, in those cases it's hard to imagine that INTERRUPTIBLE_IN_EMERGENCY wouldn't be true anyway.
