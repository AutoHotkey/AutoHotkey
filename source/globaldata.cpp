// The order of initialization here must match the order in the enum contained in script.h

// globaldata.h in modules that only need access to the enum's constants, which in turn prevents
// many mutual dependency problems between modules).  Note: Action names must not contain any
// spaces or tabs because within a script, those characters can be used in lieu of a delimiter
// to separate the action-type-name from the first parameter.

// STEPS TO ADD A NEW COMMAND:
// 1) Add an entry to the command enum in script.h.
// 2) Add an entry to the below array (it's position here MUST exactly match that in the enum).
//    The first item is the command name, the second is the minimum number of parameters (e.g.
//    if you enter 3, the first 3 args are mandatory) and the third is the maximum number of
//    parameters (the user need not escape commas within the last parameter).
//    Note: If you use a value for MinParams than is greater than zero, remember than any params
//    beneath that threshold will also be required to be non-blank (i.e. user can't omit them even
//    if later, non-blank params are provided).
// 3) If the new command has any params that are output or input vars, change Line::ArgIsVar().
// 4) Implement the command in Line::ExecUntil().
//    If the command waits for anything (e.g. calls MsgSleep()), be sure to make a local
//    copy of any ARG values that are needed during the wait period, because if another hotkey
//    subroutine suspends the current one while its waiting, it could also overwrite the ARG
//    deref buffer with its own values.
