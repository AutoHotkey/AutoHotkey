			// 1) The first control created is at the top of the Z-order (i.e. the lowest z-order number
			//    and the first in tab navigation), the second is next, and so on.
			// 2) Controls get drawn in ascending Z-order (i.e. the first control is drawn first
			//    and any later controls that overlap are drawn on top of it, except for controls that
			//    have WS_CLIPSIBLINGS).
			// 3) When a user clicks a point that contains two overlapping controls and each control is
			//    capable of capturing clicks, the one closer to the top captures the click even though it
			//    was drawn beneath (overlapped by) the other control.
			// Because of this behavior, the following policy seems best:
			// 1) Move all static images to the top of the Z-order so that other controls are always
			//    drawn on top of them.  This is done because it seems to be the behavior that would
			//    be desired at least 90% of the time.
			// 2) Do not do the same for static text and GroupBoxes because it seems too rare that
			//    overlapping would be done in such cases, and even if it is done it seems more
			//    flexible to allow the order in which the controls were created to determine how they
			//    overlap and which one get the clicks.
			//
			// Rather than push static pictures to the top in the reverse order they were created -- 
			// which might be a little more intuitive since the ones created first would then always
			// be "behind" ones created later -- for simplicity, we do it here at the time the control
			// is created.  This avoids complications such as a picture being added after the
			// window is shown for the first time and then not getting sent to the top where it
			// should be.  Update: The control is now kept in its original order for two reasons:
			// 1) The reason mentioned above (that later images should overlap earlier images).
			// 2) Allows Rajat's SmartGUI Creator to support picture controls (due to its grid background pic).
			// First find the last picture control in the array.  The last one should already be beneath
			// all the others in the z-order due to having been originally added using the below method.
			// Might eventually need to switch to EnumWindows() if it's possible for Z-order to be

		//  - WM_ACTIVATE, WA_ACTIVE (again)
		//
		// So apparently if the window doesn't set focus in response to WM_ACTIVATE, the system calls
		// SetFocus(hWnd).  But even though it does that, it calls SetFocus(hWnd) again afterward!
		//
		// Another attempted workaround was to have WM_SETFOCUS do SetFocus(wParam) if wParam was this
		// window's own control.  This worked, but the focus changed several times each time the window
		// was restored, and for some controls this generates redundant focus and lost-focus events.
		//
		// To solve this we suppress both WM_ACTIVATE and WM_SETFOCUS in between WM_SIZE, SIZE_MINIMIZED
		// and the next WM_SIZE with any other parameter value.  The end result is that when the window
		// is activated, the window itself is focused (which normally happens, temporarily) and then
		// focus changes only once, when WM_ACTIVATE is received after WM_SIZE.  There is no second
		// WM_SETFOCUS, because hWnd already has the focus.
		//
		// WM_SIZE is tracked with mIsMinimized rather than using IsIconic(hWnd) because the iconic state
		// of the window changes before the transition is completed (which is probably why WM_ACTIVATE's
		// wParam doesn't indicate that the window is minimized).
		//
		// Note that this issue didn't occur in at least the following cases:
		//  1) If the window is activated before restoring it, WM_ACTIVATE is received while the window
		//     is definitely in the minimized state (and not in transition), therefore DefDlgProc does
		//     not handle it by changing the focus.
		//  2) If the window is restored via the taskbar button, it loses focus when the user clicks the
		//     taskbar, so see above.
		//  3) If the window is minimized via the taskbar button, it can be restored even without first
		//     activating it.  This seems to be a consequence of some shonky handling by the system, as
		//     it sends WM_ACTIVATE, 0x00200001 (WA_ACTIVE with upper word non-zero, meaning minimized),
		//     even though the window IS NOT ACTIVE, and then when the window is activated, WM_ACTIVATE
		//     is not sent (and without that message, there is no premature focus restoration).
		//     I came across several mentions of this issue with WM_ACTIVATE and the taskbar in my searches.
		//     Note that sending the bogus message manually produces a different result; i.e. WM_ACTIVATE
		//     is still sent by the system when the window is restored.

	// BACKGROUND ABOUT THE ABOVE:
	// Rather than launching the thread directly from here, it seems best to always post it to our
	// thread to be handled there.  Here are the reasons:
	// 1) We don't want to be in the situation where a thread launched here would return first
	//    to a dialog's message pump rather than MsgSleep's pump.  That's because our thread
	//    might have queued messages that would then be misrouted or lost because the dialog's
	//    dispatched them incorrectly, or didn't know what to do with them because they had a
	//    NULL hwnd.
	// 2) If the script happens to be uninterruptible, we would want to "re-queue" the messages
	//    in this fashion anyway (doing so avoids possible conflict if the current quasi-thread
	//    is in the middle of a critical operation, such as trying to open the clipboard for 
	//    a command it is right in the middle of executing).
	// 3) "Re-queuing" this event *only* for case #2 might cause problems with losing the original
	//     sequence of events that occurred in the GUI.  For example, if some events were re-queued
	//     due to uninterruptibility, but other more recent ones were not (because the thread became
	//     interruptible again at a critical moment), the more recent events would take effect before
	//     the older ones.  Requeuing all events ensures that when they do take effect, they do so
	//     in their original order.
	//
	// More explanation about Case #1 above.  Consider this order of events: 1) Current thread is
	// waiting for dialog, thus that dialog's msg pump is running. 2) User presses a button on GUI
	// window, and then another while the prev. button's thread is still uninterruptible (perhaps
	// this happened due to automating the form with the Send command).  3) Due to uninterruptibility,
	// this event would be re-queued to the thread's msg queue.  4) If the first thread ends before any
	// call to MsgSleep(), we'll be back at the dialog's msg pump again, and thus the requeued message
	// would be misrouted or discarded due to automatic dispatching.
	//
	// Info about why events are buffered when script is uninterruptible:
 	// It seems best to buffer GUI events that would trigger a new thread, rather than ignoring
	// them or allowing them to launch unconditionally.  Ignoring them is bad because lost events
	// might cause a GUI to get out of sync with how its controls are designed to update and
	// interact with each other.  Allowing them to launch anyway is bad in the case where
	// a critical operation for another thread is underway (such as attempting to open the
	// clipboard).  Thus, post this event back to our thread so that even if a msg pump
	// other than our own is running (such as MsgBox or another dialog), the msg will stay
	// buffered (the msg might bounce around fiercely if we kept posting it to our WindowProc,
	// since any other msg pump would not have the buffering filter in place that ours has).
	//
	// UPDATE: I think some of the above might be obsolete now.  Consider this order of events:
	// 1) Current thread is waiting for dialog, thus that dialog's msg pump is running. 2) User presses
	// a button on GUI window. 3) We receive that message here and post it below. 4) When we exit,
	// the dialog's msg pump receives the message and dispatches it to GuiWindowProc. 5) GuiWindowProc
	// posts the message and immediately does a MsgSleep to force our msg pump to handle the message.
	// 6) Everything is fine unless our msg pump leaves the message queued due to uninterruptibility,

	// Do a "virtual qsort" on this column's contents by having qsort() sort an array of row numbers according

	// special "lParam container" (for example, 3,1,2 would store 1 in row 3, 2 in row 1, and 3 in row 2, and 4 in...).
	// Then the ListView can be sorted via a method like the high performance LV_Int32Sort.
