			//    capable of capturing clicks, the one closer to the top captures the click even though it
			//    was drawn beneath (overlapped by) the other control.
			// Because of this behavior, the following policy seems best:
			// 1) Move all static images to the top of the Z-order so that other controls are always
			//    drawn on top of them.  This is done because it seems to be the behavior that would
			//    be desired at least 90% of the time.
			// 2) Do not do the same for static text and GroupBoxes because it seems too rare that
			//    overlapping would be done in such cases, and even if it is done it seems more
			//    flexible to allow the order in which the controls were created to determine how they
			//    overlap and which one get the clicks.
			//
			// Rather than push static pictures to the top in the reverse order they were created -- 
			// which might be a little more intuitive since the ones created first would then always
			// be "behind" ones created later -- for simplicity, we do it here at the time the control
			// is created.  This avoids complications such as a picture being added after the
			// window is shown for the first time and then not getting sent to the top where it
			// should be.  Update: The control is now kept in its original order for two reasons:
			// 1) The reason mentioned above (that later images should overlap earlier images).
			// 2) Allows Rajat's SmartGUI Creator to support picture controls (due to its grid background pic).
			// First find the last picture control in the array.  The last one should already be beneath
			// all the others in the z-order due to having been originally added using the below method.

	// thread to be handled there.  Here are the reasons:
	// 1) We don't want to be in the situation where a thread launched here would return first
	//    to a dialog's message pump rather than MsgSleep's pump.  That's because our thread
	//    might have queued messages that would then be misrouted or lost because the dialog's
	//    dispatched them incorrectly, or didn't know what to do with them because they had a
	//    NULL hwnd.
	// 2) If the script happens to be uninterruptible, we would want to "re-queue" the messages
	//    in this fashion anyway (doing so avoids possible conflict if the current quasi-thread
	//    is in the middle of a critical operation, such as trying to open the clipboard for 
	//    a command it is right in the middle of executing).
	// 3) "Re-queuing" this event *only* for case #2 might cause problems with losing the original
	//     sequence of events that occurred in the GUI.  For example, if some events were re-queued
	//     due to uninterruptibility, but other more recent ones were not (because the thread became
	//     interruptible again at a critical moment), the more recent events would take effect before
	//     the older ones.  Requeuing all events ensures that when they do take effect, they do so
	//     in their original order.
	//
	// More explanation about Case #1 above.  Consider this order of events: 1) Current thread is
	// waiting for dialog, thus that dialog's msg pump is running. 2) User presses a button on GUI
	// window, and then another while the prev. button's thread is still uninterruptible (perhaps
	// this happened due to automating the form with the Send command).  3) Due to uninterruptibility,
	// this event would be re-queued to the thread's msg queue.  4) If the first thread ends before any
	// call to MsgSleep(), we'll be back at the dialog's msg pump again, and thus the requeued message
	// would be misrouted or discarded due to automatic dispatching.
	//
	// Info about why events are buffered when script is uninterruptible:
 	// It seems best to buffer GUI events that would trigger a new thread, rather than ignoring
	// them or allowing them to launch unconditionally.  Ignoring them is bad because lost events
	// might cause a GUI to get out of sync with how its controls are designed to update and
	// interact with each other.  Allowing them to launch anyway is bad in the case where
	// a critical operation for another thread is underway (such as attempting to open the
	// clipboard).  Thus, post this event back to our thread so that even if a msg pump
	// other than our own is running (such as MsgBox or another dialog), the msg will stay
	// buffered (the msg might bounce around fiercely if we kept posting it to our WindowProc,
	// since any other msg pump would not have the buffering filter in place that ours has).
	//
	// UPDATE: I think some of the above might be obsolete now.  Consider this order of events:
	// 1) Current thread is waiting for dialog, thus that dialog's msg pump is running. 2) User presses
	// a button on GUI window. 3) We receive that message here and post it below. 4) When we exit,
	// the dialog's msg pump receives the message and dispatches it to GuiWindowProc. 5) GuiWindowProc
	// posts the message and immediately does a MsgSleep to force our msg pump to handle the message.
	// 6) Everything is fine unless our msg pump leaves the message queued due to uninterruptibility,
	// in which case the msg will bounce around, possibly maxing the CPU, until either the dialog's msg
	// pump ends or the other thread becomes interruptible (which usually doesn't take more than 20 ms).
	// If the script is uninterruptible due to some long operation such as sending keystrokes or trying
	// to open the clipboard when it is locked, any dialog message pump underneath on the call stack
	// shouldn't be an issue because the long-operation (clipboard/Send) does not return to that
	// msg pump until the operation is complete; in other words, the message to stay queued rather than
	// bouncing around.
	//
	// Concerning the practice of saving to a control's output variable prior to posting this message:
	// It's true that this would cause any other queued/unprocessed messages of the same event/control
	// to share the same value, which is undesirable but rare in practice (and usually inconsequential,
	// since only the most recent value tends to matter, not those that happened very quickly in between).
	// The code-simplicity of this approach seems worthwhile for now.
	// More info: In many cases (e.g. Slider), the control's output var is set to the value before posting
	// the message.  Therefore, if there are any of the same messages still in the queue when a new one
	// is posted, they will all have the same output-var value.  If you consider that output-var update is
	// just a convenience, this isn't much of an issue because if the script were to do GuiControlGet on it,
	// the same effect would occur.  But still, it should be fixed for those situations where it's important
	// (there don't appear to be any control types where this is important, but here's the list of those
	// whose g-labels change the value of the output-var):
	//GUI_CONTROL_LISTVIEW?
	//GUI_CONTROL_HOTKEY
	//GUI_CONTROL_DATETIME
	//GUI_CONTROL_MONTHCAL
	//GUI_CONTROL_UPDOWN
	//GUI_CONTROL_SLIDER
	//GUI_CONTROL_TAB (in GuiWindowProc)

	// Although an additional WORD of info could be squeezed into the message by passing the control's HWND
	// instead of the parent window's (and the msg pump could then look up the parent window via
	// GetNonChildParent), it's probably not feasible because if some other message pump is running, it would
	// route AHK_GUI_ACTION messages to the window proc. of the control rather than the parent window, which
	// would prevent them from being re-posted back to the queue (see "case AHK_GUI_ACTION" in GuiWindowProc()).

	// 3) There's a slight possibility that changing it would break existing scripts that rely on uppercase.

	// the only difference between them is the type "LPWSTR pszText", which is no problem as long as caller
	// has properly halved cchTextMax to reflect that wide-chars are twice as wide as 8-bit characters.

	// callback function sends any messages to the list-view control, the results are unpredictable (aside
	// from LVM_GETITEM, which is allowed by ListView_SortItemsEx but not ListView_SortItems)."
	// Since SortItemsEx has become so much more common/available, the doubt about whether the non-Ex

	// UPDATE: The following seems to be one alternative:
	// Do a "virtual qsort" on this column's contents by having qsort() sort an array of row numbers according

	// (e.g. 3,1,2). Next, traverse the array and store the correct "order number" in the corresponding row's
	// special "lParam container" (for example, 3,1,2 would store 1 in row 3, 2 in row 1, and 3 in row 2, and 4 in...).
	// Then the ListView can be sorted via a method like the high performance LV_Int32Sort.
	// However, since the above would require TWO SORTS, it would probably be slower (though the second sort would
	// require only a tiny fraction of the time of the first).
