			// that's not enough to make things work for him.  If only TEXT controls were ALSO reordered
			// to be at the top of the list (so that all statics retain their original ordering with
			// respect to each other) I have a 90% expectation (based on testing) that prefix/shortcut
			// keys inside static text controls would jump to the wrong control because their associated
			// control seems to be based solely on z-order.  ANOTHER REASON NOT to ever change the z-order
			// of controls automatically: Every time a picture is added, it would increment the z-order
			// number of all other control types by 1.  This is bad especially for text controls because
			// they are static just like pictures, and thus their Class+NN "unique ID" would change (as
			// seen by the ControlXXX commands) if a picture were ever added after a window was shown.
			// Older note: calling SetWindowPos() with HWND_TOPMOST doesn't seem to provide any useful
			// effect that I could discern (by contrast, HWND_TOP does actually move a control to the
			// top of the z-order).
			// The below is OBSOLETE and its code further below is commented out:
			// Facts about how overlapping controls are drawn vs. which one receives mouse clicks:
			// 1) The first control created is at the top of the Z-order (i.e. the lowest z-order number
			//    and the first in tab navigation), the second is next, and so on.
			// 2) Controls get drawn in ascending Z-order (i.e. the first control is drawn first
			//    and any later controls that overlap are drawn on top of it, except for controls that
			//    have WS_CLIPSIBLINGS).
			// 3) When a user clicks a point that contains two overlapping controls and each control is
			//    capable of capturing clicks, the one closer to the top captures the click even though it
			//    was drawn beneath (overlapped by) the other control.
			// Because of this behavior, the following policy seems best:
			// 1) Move all static images to the top of the Z-order so that other controls are always
			//    drawn on top of them.  This is done because it seems to be the behavior that would
			//    be desired at least 90% of the time.
			// 2) Do not do the same for static text and GroupBoxes because it seems too rare that
			//    overlapping would be done in such cases, and even if it is done it seems more
			//    flexible to allow the order in which the controls were created to determine how they
			//    overlap and which one get the clicks.
			//
			// Rather than push static pictures to the top in the reverse order they were created -- 
			// which might be a little more intuitive since the ones created first would then always
			// be "behind" ones created later -- for simplicity, we do it here at the time the control
			// is created.  This avoids complications such as a picture being added after the
			// window is shown for the first time and then not getting sent to the top where it
			// should be.  Update: The control is now kept in its original order for two reasons:
			// 1) The reason mentioned above (that later images should overlap earlier images).
			// 2) Allows Rajat's SmartGUI Creator to support picture controls (due to its grid background pic).
			// First find the last picture control in the array.  The last one should already be beneath
			// all the others in the z-order due to having been originally added using the below method.

	// BACKGROUND ABOUT THE ABOVE:
	// Rather than launching the thread directly from here, it seems best to always post it to our
	// thread to be handled there.  Here are the reasons:
	// 1) We don't want to be in the situation where a thread launched here would return first
	//    to a dialog's message pump rather than MsgSleep's pump.  That's because our thread
	//    might have queued messages that would then be misrouted or lost because the dialog's
	//    dispatched them incorrectly, or didn't know what to do with them because they had a
	//    NULL hwnd.
	// 2) If the script happens to be uninterruptible, we would want to "re-queue" the messages
	//    in this fashion anyway (doing so avoids possible conflict if the current quasi-thread
	//    is in the middle of a critical operation, such as trying to open the clipboard for 
	//    a command it is right in the middle of executing).
	// 3) "Re-queuing" this event *only* for case #2 might cause problems with losing the original
	//     sequence of events that occurred in the GUI.  For example, if some events were re-queued
	//     due to uninterruptibility, but other more recent ones were not (because the thread became
	//     interruptible again at a critical moment), the more recent events would take effect before
	//     the older ones.  Requeuing all events ensures that when they do take effect, they do so
	//     in their original order.
	//
	// More explanation about Case #1 above.  Consider this order of events: 1) Current thread is
	// waiting for dialog, thus that dialog's msg pump is running. 2) User presses a button on GUI
	// window, and then another while the prev. button's thread is still uninterruptible (perhaps
	// this happened due to automating the form with the Send command).  3) Due to uninterruptibility,
	// this event would be re-queued to the thread's msg queue.  4) If the first thread ends before any
	// call to MsgSleep(), we'll be back at the dialog's msg pump again, and thus the requeued message
	// would be misrouted or discarded due to automatic dispatching.
	//
	// Info about why events are buffered when script is uninterruptible:
 	// It seems best to buffer GUI events that would trigger a new thread, rather than ignoring
	// them or allowing them to launch unconditionally.  Ignoring them is bad because lost events
	// might cause a GUI to get out of sync with how its controls are designed to update and
	// interact with each other.  Allowing them to launch anyway is bad in the case where
	// a critical operation for another thread is underway (such as attempting to open the
	// clipboard).  Thus, post this event back to our thread so that even if a msg pump
	// other than our own is running (such as MsgBox or another dialog), the msg will stay
	// buffered (the msg might bounce around fiercely if we kept posting it to our WindowProc,
	// since any other msg pump would not have the buffering filter in place that ours has).
	//
	// UPDATE: I think some of the above might be obsolete now.  Consider this order of events:
	// 1) Current thread is waiting for dialog, thus that dialog's msg pump is running. 2) User presses
	// a button on GUI window. 3) We receive that message here and post it below. 4) When we exit,
	// the dialog's msg pump receives the message and dispatches it to GuiWindowProc. 5) GuiWindowProc
	// posts the message and immediately does a MsgSleep to force our msg pump to handle the message.
	// 6) Everything is fine unless our msg pump leaves the message queued due to uninterruptibility,
	// in which case the msg will bounce around, possibly maxing the CPU, until either the dialog's msg
	// pump ends or the other thread becomes interruptible (which usually doesn't take more than 20 ms).
	// If the script is uninterruptible due to some long operation such as sending keystrokes or trying
	// to open the clipboard when it is locked, any dialog message pump underneath on the call stack
	// shouldn't be an issue because the long-operation (clipboard/Send) does not return to that
	// msg pump until the operation is complete; in other words, the message to stay queued rather than
	// bouncing around.

	// Although an additional WORD of info could be squeezed into the message by passing the control's HWND
	// instead of the parent window's (and the msg pump could then look up the parent window via
	// GetNonChildParent), it's probably not feasible because if some other message pump is running, it would
	// route AHK_GUI_ACTION messages to the window proc. of the control rather than the parent window, which
	// would prevent them from being re-posted back to the queue (see "case AHK_GUI_ACTION" in GuiWindowProc()).

	// produce an unwanted shift keystroke if for some reason the script uses the Send command to send the hotkey.
	// However, for the following reasons, it seems best not to try to "fix" it:
	// 1) There's no telling what names (single-character or otherwise) various keyboard layouts/languages
	//    might produce.
	// 2) ^A seems more readable than ^a (which is probably the exact reason the OS's hotkey control displays it
	//     in uppercase).  Of course, this has merit only when the script actually displays the hotkey somewhere.
	// 3) There's a slight possibility that changing it would break existing scripts that rely on uppercase.
	// 4) Using the Send command to send the hotkey seems very rare; the script would normally Gosub the hotkey's
	//    subroutine instead.
	return VKtoKeyName(vk, cp, 100);

	// v1.0.48: The above calls GetKeyName(), which calls GetKeyNameText(), which produces the character's
	// name rather than the character itself if the VK is a dead key (e.g. Zircumflex rather than ^ in the
	// German keyboard layout).  Since such names are not currently supported by commands like
	// Hotkey/GetKeyState/Send, try another method to convert it.  Testing shows that MapVirtualKey() produces
	// the correct character, at least for dead keys in the German keyboard layout.
	// Update by Lexikos on 2011-07-23: GetKeyNameText() is no longer used.

	// from LVM_GETITEM, which is allowed by ListView_SortItemsEx but not ListView_SortItems)."
	// Since SortItemsEx has become so much more common/available, the doubt about whether the non-Ex

	// documented) much less of a concern.

	// ever use ListView_SortItems() without either having LVS_OWNERDATA or allocating temp memory for the
	// entire column (to whose rows lParam would point)?
	// UPDATE: The following seems to be one alternative:
	// Do a "virtual qsort" on this column's contents by having qsort() sort an array of row numbers according
	// to the contents of each particular row's field in that column (i.e. qsort's callback would call LV_GETITEM).
	// In other words, the array would start off in order (1,2,3) but afterward would contain the proper sort
	// (e.g. 3,1,2). Next, traverse the array and store the correct "order number" in the corresponding row's
	// special "lParam container" (for example, 3,1,2 would store 1 in row 3, 2 in row 1, and 3 in row 2, and 4 in...).
	// Then the ListView can be sorted via a method like the high performance LV_Int32Sort.
