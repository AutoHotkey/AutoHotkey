// Notes about the below macro:
// Update for v1.0.40.01:
// In earlier versions, a critical thread that displayed a dialog would discard any pending events
// that were waiting to start new threads (since in most cases, the dialog message pump would
// route those events directly to a window proc, which would then repost them with a NULL hwnd
// to prevent bouncing, which in turn would cause the dialog pump to discard them).  To avoid
// this and make the behavior more useful and intuitive, this has been changed so that any
// pending threads will launch right before the dialog is displayed.  But later, when the user
// dismisses the dialog, the thread becomes critical again.
// 
// Update for v1.0.38.04: Rather than setting AllowInterruption unconditionally to
// true, make it reflect the state of g->ThreadIsCritical.  This increases flexibility by allowing
// threads to stay interrruptible even when they're displaying a dialog.  In such cases, an
// incoming thread-event such as a hotkey will get routed to our MainWindowProc by the dialog's
// message pump; and from there it will get reposted to our queue, and then get pumped again.
// This bouncing effect may impact performance slightly but seems warranted to maintain
// flexibility of the "Critical" command as well as its ability to buffer incoming events.
//
// If our thread's message queue has any message pending whose HWND member is NULL -- or even
// normal messages which would be routed back to the thread by the WindowProc() -- clean them
// out of the message queue before launching the dialog's message pump below.  That message pump
// doesn't know how to properly handle such messages (it would either lose them or dispatch them
// at times we don't want them dispatched).  But first ensure the current quasi-thread is
// interruptible, since it's about to display a dialog so there little benefit (and a high cost)
// to leaving it uninterruptible.  The "high cost" is that MsgSleep (our main message pump) would
// filter out (leave queued) certain messages if the script were uninterruptible.  Then when it
// returned, the dialog message pump below would start, and it would discard or misroute the
// messages.
// If this is not done, the following scenario would also be a problem:
// A newly launched thread (in its period of uninterruptibility) displays a dialog.  As a consequence,
// the dialog's message pump starts dispatching all messages.  If during this brief time (before the
// thread becomes interruptible) a hotkey/hotstring/custom menu item/gui thread is dispatched to one
// of our WindowProc's, and then posted to our thread via PostMessage(NULL,...), the item would be lost
// because the dialog message pump discards messages that lack an HWND (since it doesn't know how to
// dispatch them to a Window Proc).
// GetQueueStatus() is used because unlike PeekMessage() or GetMessage(), it might not yield
// our timeslice if the CPU is under heavy load, which would be good to improve performance here.
