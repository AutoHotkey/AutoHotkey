// These macros used to keep app responsive during a long operation.  In v1.0.39, the
// hooks have a dedicated thread.  However, mLastPeekTime is still compared to 5 rather
// than some higher value for the following reasons:
// 1) Want hotkeys pressed during a long operation to take effect as quickly as possible.
//    For example, in games a hotkey's response time is critical.
// 2) Benchmarking shows less than a 0.5% performance improvement from this comparing
//    to a higher value (even one as high as 500), even when the system is under heavy
//    load from other processes).
//
// mLastPeekTime is global/static so that recursive functions, such as FileSetAttrib(),
// will sleep as often as intended even if the target files require frequent recursion.
// The use of a global/static is not friendly to recursive calls to the function (i.e. calls
// made as a consequence of the current script subroutine being interrupted by another during
// this instance's MsgSleep()).  However, it doesn't seem to be that much of a consequence
// since the exact interval/period of the MsgSleep()'s isn't that important.  It's also
// pretty unlikely that the interrupting subroutine will also just happen to call the same
// function rather than some other.

// the operation.  The operation will be resumed after the interrupting subroutine finishes.
// Notes applying to the macro:
// Store tick_now for use later, in case the Peek() isn't done, though not all callers need it later.
// ...
// Since the Peek() will yield when there are no messages, it will often take 20ms or more to return
// (UPDATE: this can't be reproduced with simple tests, so either the OS has changed through service
// packs, or Peek() yields only when the OS detects that the app is calling it too often or calling
// it in certain ways [PM_REMOVE vs. PM_NOREMOVE seems to make no difference: either way it doesn't yield]).
// Therefore, must update tick_now again (its value is used by macro and possibly by its caller)
// to avoid having to Peek() immediately after the next iteration.
// ...
