/*
   C++ functions for MT19937, with initialization improved 2002/2/10.
   Coded by Takuji Nishimura and Makoto Matsumoto.
   This is a faster version by taking Shawn Cokus's optimization,
   Matthe Bellew's simplification, Isaku Wada's real version.

   Before using, initialize the state by using init_genrand(seed)
   or init_by_array(init_key, key_length).
