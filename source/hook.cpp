// Notes about the following variables:
// Used to help make a workaround for the way the keyboard driver generates physical
// shift-key events to release the shift key whenever it is physically down during
// the press or release of a dual-state Numpad key. These keyboard driver generated
// shift-key events only seem to happen when Numlock is ON, the shift key is logically
// or physically down, and a dual-state numpad key is pressed or released (i.e. the shift
// key might not have been down for the press, but if it's down for the release, the driver
// will suddenly start generating shift events).  I think the purpose of these events is to
// allow the shift keyto temporarily alter the state of the Numlock key for the purpose of
// sending that one key, without the shift key actually being "seen" as down while the key
// itself is sent (since some apps may have special behavior when they detect the shift key
// is down).

// Note: numlock, numpaddiv/mult/sub/add/enter are not affected by this because they have only
// a single state (i.e. they are unaffected by the state of the Numlock key).  Also, these
// driver-generated events occur at a level lower than the hook, so it doesn't matter whether
// the hook suppresses the keys involved (i.e. the shift events still happen anyway).

// So which keys are not physical even though they're non-injected?:
// 1) The shift-up that precedes a down of a dual-state numpad key (only happens when shift key is logically down).
// 2) The shift-down that precedes a pressing down (or releasing in certain very rare cases caused by the
//    exact sequence of keys received) of a key WHILE the numpad key in question is still down.
//    Although this case may seem rare, it's happened to both Robert Yaklin and myself when doing various
//    sorts of hotkeys.
// 3) The shift-up that precedes an up of a dual-state numpad key.  This only happens if the shift key is
//    logically down for any reason at this exact moment, which can be achieved via the send command.
// 4) The shift-down that follows the up of a dual-state numpad key (i.e. the driver is restoring the shift state
//    to what it was before).  This can be either immediate or "lazy".  It's lazy whenever the user had pressed
//    another key while a numpad key was being held down (i.e. case #2 above), in which case the driver waits
//    indefinitely for the user to press any other key and then immediately sneaks in the shift key-down event
//    right before it in the input stream (insertion).
// 5) Similar to #4, but if the driver needs to generate a shift-up for an unexpected Numpad-up event,
//    the restoration of the shift key will be "lazy".  This case was added in response to the below
//    example, wherein the shift key got stuck physically down (incorrectly) by the hook:
// 68  048	 	d	0.00	Num 8          	
// 6B  04E	 	d	0.09	Num +          	
// 68  048	i	d	0.00	Num 8          	
// 68  048	i	u	0.00	Num 8          	
// A0  02A	i	d	0.02	Shift          	part of the macro
// 01  000	i	d	0.03	LButton        	
// A0  02A	 	u	0.00	Shift          	driver, for the next key
// 26  048	 	u	0.00	Num 8          	
// A0  02A	 	d	0.49	Shift          	driver lazy down (but not detected as non-physical)
// 6B  04E	 	d	0.00	Num +          	

// The below timeout is for the subset of driver-generated shift-events that occur immediately
// before or after some other keyboard event.  The elapsed time is usually zero, but using 22ms
// here just in case slower systems or systems under load have longer delays between keystrokes:

One of the main objectives of a the hooks is to minimize the amount of CPU overhead caused by every
input event being handled by the procedure.  One way this is done is to return immediately on
simple conditions that are relatively frequent (such as receiving a key that's not involved in any
hotkey combination).

Another way is to avoid API or system calls that might have a high overhead.  That's why the state of
every prefix key is tracked independently, rather than calling the WinAPI to determine if the
key is actually down at the moment of consideration.

				//#InstallMouseHook
				//Gui, +AlwaysOnTop
				//Gui, Show, w200 h100
				//return
				// The problem came about from the following sequence of events:
				// 1) User clicks the one of the script's window's title bar's close, minimize, or maximize button.
				// 2) WM_NCLBUTTONDOWN is sent to the window's window proc, which then passes it on to
				//    DefWindowProc or DefDlgProc, which then apparently enters a loop in which no messages
				//    (or a very limited subset) are pumped.
				// 3) If anyone sends a message to that window (such as GetWindowText(), which sends a message
				//    in cases where it doesn't have the title pre-cached), the message will not receive a reply
				//    until after the mouse button is released.
				// 4) But the hook is the very thing that's supposed to release the mouse button, and it can't
				//    until a reply is received.
				// 5) Thus, a deadlock occurs.  So after a short but noticeable delay, the OS sees the hook as
				//    unresponsive and bypasses it, sending the click through normally, which breaks the deadlock.
				// 6) A similar situation might arise when a right-click-down is sent to the title bar or
				//    sys-menu-icon.
				//
				// SOLUTION:
				// Post the message to our main thread to have it do the GetWindowText call.  That way, if
				// the target window is one of the main thread's own window's, there's no chance it can be
				// in an unreponsive state like the deadlock described above.  In addition, do this for ALL
				// windows because its simpler, more maintainable, and especially might sovle other hook
				// performance problems if GetWindowText() has other situations where it is slow to return
				// (which seems likely).
				// Although the above solution could create rare situations where there's a lag before window text
				// is updated, that seems unlikely to be common or have signficant consequences.  Furthermore,

		// the user releases LShift, the up-event is suppressed here, which causes the key to get
		// stuck down.  That could be fixed in the following ways, but all of them seem likely to break
		// more things than they fix, especially given the rarity that both a hotkey of this type would
		// exist and its mirror image does something useful that isn't a hotkey (for example, Shift+MButton
		// is a meaningful action in few if any applications):
		// 1) Don't suppress the physical release of a suffix key if that key is logically down (as reported
		//    by GetKeyState/GetAsyncKeyState): Seems too broad in scope because there might be cases where
		//    the script or user wants the key to stay logically down (e.g. Send {Shift down}{a down}).
		// 2) Same as #1 but limit the non-suppression to only times when the suffix key was logically down
		//    when its first qualified physical down-event came in.  This is definitely better but like
		//    #1, the uncertainty of breaking existing scripts and/or causing more harm than good seems too
		//    high.
		// 3) Same as #2 but limit it only to cases where the suffix key is a keyboard key and its prefix
		//    is a mouse key.  Although very selective, it doesn't mitigate the fact it might still do more

	// because ToAsciiEx() finds no translation-to-char for them:
	// pgup/dn/home/end/ins/del/arrowkeys/f1-f24/etc.
	// Note that if a pending dead key is followed by the press of another dead key (including itself),
	// the sequence should be triggered and both keystrokes should appear in the active window.
	// That case has been tested too, and works okay with the layouts tested so far.
	// I've only discovered two keys which need special handling, and they are handled below:
	// VK_TAB & VK_ESCAPE
	// These keys have an ascii translation but should not trigger/complete a pending dead key,
	// at least not on the Spanish and Danish layouts, which are the two I've tested so far.

	// Dead keys in Danish layout as they appear on a US English keyboard: Equals and Plus /
	// Right bracket & Brace / probably others.

	// SUMMARY OF DEAD KEY ISSUE:
	// Calling ToAsciiEx() on the dead key itself doesn't disrupt anything. The disruption occurs on the next key
	// (for which the dead key is pending): ToAsciiEx() consumes previous/pending dead key, which causes the
	// active window's call of ToAsciiEx() to fail to see a dead key. So unless the program reinserts the dead key
	// after the call to ToAsciiEx() but before allowing the dead key's successor key to pass through to the
	// active window, that window would see a non-diacritic like "u" instead of .  In other words, the program
	// "uses up" the dead key to populate its own hotstring buffer, depriving the active window of the dead key.
	//
	// JAVA ISSUE: Hotstrings are known to disrupt dead keys in Java apps on some systems (though not my XP one).
	// I spent several hours on it but was unable to solve it using anything other than a Sleep(20) after the
	// reinsertion of the dead key (and PhiLho reports that even that didn't fully solve it).  A Sleep here in the
	// hook would probably do more harm than good, so is avoided for now.  Other approaches:
	// 1) Send a simulated substitute for the successor key rather than allowing the hook to pass it through.
	//    Maybe that would somehow put things in a better order for Java.  However, there might be side-effects to
	//    that, such as in DirectX games.
	// 2) Have main thread (rather than hook thread) reinsert the dead key and its successor key (hook would have
	//    suppressed both), which allows the main thread to do a Sleep or MsgSleep.  Such a Sleep be more effective
	//    because the main thread's priority is lower than that of the hook's, allowing better round-robin.
	// 
	// If this key isn't a dead key but there's a dead key pending and this incoming key is capable of
	// completing/triggering it, do a workaround for the side-effects of ToAsciiEx().  This workaround
	// allows dead keys to continue to operate properly in the user's foreground window, while still
	// being capturable by the Input command and recognizable by any defined hotstrings whose
	// abbreviations use diacritical letters:

			// Note that the above must also be done in such a way that it works on NT4, which doesn't support
			// below-normal and above-normal process priorities, nor perhaps other aspects of priority.
			// So what is the actual priority given to the hooks by the OS?  Assuming that the script's
			// process is set to NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS (which is the default), the following applies:
			// First of all, a definition: "base priority" is the actual/net priority of the thread.
			// It determines how the OS will schedule a thread relative to all other threads on the system.
			// So in a sense, if you look only at base priority, the thread's process's priority has no
			// bearing on how the thread will get scheduled (except to the extent that it contributes
			// to the calculation of the base priority itself).  Here are some common base priorities
			// along with where the hook priority (15) fits in:
			// 7 = NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS process + THREAD_PRIORITY_NORMAL thread.
			// 9 = NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS process + THREAD_PRIORITY_HIGHEST thread.
			// 13 = HIGH_PRIORITY_CLASS process + THREAD_PRIORITY_NORMAL thread.
			// 15 = (ANY)_PRIORITY_CLASS process + THREAD_PRIORITY_TIME_CRITICAL thread. <-- Seems like the optimal compromise.
			// 15 = HIGH_PRIORITY_CLASS process + THREAD_PRIORITY_HIGHEST thread.
			// 24 = REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS process + THREAD_PRIORITY_NORMAL thread.

	// Post the AHK_CHANGE_HOOK_STATE message to the new thread to put the right hooks into effect.

	// PostThreadMessage() has been observed to fail, such as when a script replaces a previous instance
	// of itself via #SingleInstance.  I think this happens because the new thread hasn't yet had a
	// chance to create its message queue via GetMessage().  So rather than using something like
	// WaitForSingleObject() -- which might not be reliable due to split-second timing of when the
	// queue actually gets created -- just keep retrying until time-out or PostThreadMessage() succeeds.

	// if it did, it certainly would have had time to execute GetMessage() in all but extreme/theoretical
	// cases.  Therefore, no thread check/termination attempt is done.  Alternatively, a check for
	// GetExitCodeThread() could be done followed by closing the handle and setting it to NULL, but once
