		// because not only doesn't it activate some other window first, it also doesn't appear

	// I abandoned it for now.

	// Note: It appears that MessageBox windows, and perhaps all modal dialogs in general,
	// cannot own other windows.  That's too bad because it would have allowed each new
	// MsgBox window to be owned by any previously existing one, so that the user would
	// be forced to close them in order if they were APPL_MODAL.  But it's not too big
	// an issue since the only disadvantage is that the keyboard can't be use to
	// to navigate in MessageBoxes other than the most recent.  And it's actually better
	// the way it is now in the sense that the user can dismiss the messageboxes out of
	// order, which might (in rare cases) be desirable.

	// For the above:
	// MsgBox's smart comma handling will usually prevent negatives due to the fact that it considers
	// a negative to be part of the text param.  But if it does happen, timeout after a short time,
	// which may signal the user that the script passed a bad parameter.

	// v1.0.33: The following is a workaround for the fact that an MsgBox with only an OK button
	// doesn't obey EndDialog()'s parameter:
	g->DialogHWND = NULL;
	g->MsgBoxTimedOut = false;

	// At this point, we know a dialog will be displayed.  See macro's comments for details:

	// when aOwner is minimized or hidden.

	DIALOG_END

	// If there's a timer, kill it for performance reasons since it's no longer needed.
	// Actually, this isn't easy to do because we don't know what the HWND of the MsgBox
	// window was, so don't bother:
	//if (aTimeout != 0.0)

	// messageboxes left in the background, to deal with them later.  So, in those cases,
	// we might be doing more harm than good because the user's foreground window would
	// be intrusively changed by this:

	// is even used by the function in this case?  Also, the docs aren't clear on whether
	// the function returns success or failure if the window is hung (probably failure).
	// If failure, perhaps you have to call GetLastError() to determine whether it failed
	// due to being hung or some other reason?  Does the output param dwResult have any
	// useful info in this case?  I expect what will happen is that in most cases, the OS
	// will already know that the window is hung.  However, if the window just became hung
	// in the last 5 seconds, I think it may take the remainder of the 5 seconds for the OS
	// to notice it.  However, allowing it the option of sleeping up to 5 seconds seems
	// really bad, since keyboard and mouse input would probably be frozen (actually it
	// would just be really laggy because the OS would bypass the hook during that time).
	// So some compromise value seems in order.  500ms seems about right.  UPDATE: Some
	// windows might need longer than 500ms because their threads are engaged in
	// heavy operations.  Since this method is only used as a fallback method now,
	// it seems best to give them the full 5000ms default, which is what (all?) Windows
	// OSes use as a cutoff to determine whether a window is "not responding":
	DWORD_PTR dwResult;
	#define Slow_IsWindowHung !SendMessageTimeout(aWnd, WM_NULL, 0, 0, SMTO_ABORTIFHUNG, 5000, &dwResult)

	// NEW, FASTER METHOD:
	// This newer method's worst-case performance is at least 30x faster than the worst-case
	// performance of the old method that  uses SendMessageTimeout().
	// And an even worse case can be envisioned which makes the use of this method
	// even more compelling: If the OS considers a window NOT to be hung, but the
	// window's message pump is sluggish about responding to the SendMessageTimeout() (perhaps
	// taking 2000ms or more to respond due to heavy disk I/O or other activity), the old method
	// will take several seconds to return, causing mouse and keyboard lag if our hook(s)
	// are installed; not to mention making our app's windows, tray menu, and other GUI controls
	// unresponsive during that time).  But I believe in this case the new method will return
	// instantly, since the OS has been keeping track in the background, and can tell us
	// immediately that the window isn't hung.
	// Here are some seemingly contradictory statements uttered by MSDN.  Perhaps they're
	// not contradictory if the first sentence really means "by a different thread of the same

// AutoIt3 author indicates that using WM_GETTEXT vs. GetWindowText() sometimes yields more text.
// Perhaps this is because GetWindowText() has built-in protection against hung windows and
// thus isn't actually sending WM_GETTEXT.  The method here is hopefully the best of both worlds

// Another tidbit from MSDN about SendMessage() that might be of use here sometime:

// SendMessageTimeout with SMTO_BLOCK set."  Currently not using SMTO_BLOCK because it

// Update: GetWindowText() is so much faster than SendMessage() and SendMessageTimeout(), at
// least on XP, so GetWindowTextTimeout() should probably only be used when getting the max amount
// of text is important (e.g. this function can fetch the text in a RichEdit20A control and
