// In a large script (200 KB of text) of a typical nature, using SimpleHeap rather than malloc() saves
// nearly 200 KB of memory as shown by Task Manager's "VM Size" column (2384 vs. 2580 KB).
// This is because many callers allocate chunks of memory that are very small on average.  If each
// such chunk were allocated with malloc (or worse, "new"), the percentage of system overhead
// compared to the memory actually used for such blocks would be enormous (perhaps 40 bytes of
// overhead for each malloc(), even if it's only for 3 or 4 bytes).  In addition, SimpleHeap improves
// performance to the extent that it is faster than malloc(), which it almost certainly is.  Finally,
// the OS's overall memory fragmentation may be reduced, especially if the app uses this class over
// a long period of time (hours or days).

// The size of each block in bytes.  Use a size that's a good compromise
// of avg. wastage vs. reducing memory fragmentation and overhead.
// Update: reduced it from 64K to 32K since many scripts tend to be small.
// Update 2 (fincs): Use twice as big blocks when compiling for Unicode because
// Unicode strings are twice as large.
