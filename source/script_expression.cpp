// v1.0.40.02: This is now a separate file to allow its compiler optimization settings
// to be set independently of those of the other modules.  In one benchmark, this
// improved performance of expressions and function calls by 9% (that is, when the
// other modules are set to "minimize size" such as for the AutoHotkeySC.bin file).
// This gain in performance is at the cost of a 1.5 KB increase in the size of the
// compressed code, which seems well worth it given how often expressions and
// function-calls are used (such as in loops).
//
// ExpandArgs() and related functions were also put into this file because that
// further improves performance across the board -- even for AutoHotkey.exe despite
// the fact that the only thing that changed for it was the module move, not the
// compiler settings.  Apparently, the butterfly effect can cause even minor
// modifications to impact the overall performance of the generated code by as much as
// 7%.  However, this might have more to do with cache hits and misses in the CPU than
// with the nature of the code produced by the compiler.
// UPDATE 10/18/2006: There's not much difference anymore -- in fact, using min size
// for everything makes compiled scripts slightly faster in basic benchmarks, probably
// due to the recent addition of the linker optimization that physically orders
// functions in a better order inside the EXE.  Therefore, script_expression.cpp no
// longer has a separate "favor fast code" option.

	// function call) will get up to one deref buffer of its own (i.e. only if its function body contains
	// commands that actually require a second deref buffer).  This is achieved by saving sDerefBuf's
	// pointer and setting sDerefBuf to NULL, which effectively makes the original deref buffer private
	// until the line that contains the function-calling expressions finishes completely.
	// Description of recursion and usage of multiple deref buffers:
	// 1) ExpandArgs() receives a line with one or more expressions containing one or more calls to user functions.
	// 2) Worst-case: those function-calls create a new sDerefBuf automatically via us having set sDerefBuf to NULL.
	// 3) Even worse, the bodies of those functions call other functions, which ExpandArgs() receives, resulting in
	//    a recursive leap back to step #1.
	// So the above shows how any number of new deref buffers can be created.  But that's okay as long as the
	// recursion collapses in an orderly manner (or the program exits, in which case the OS frees all its memory
	// automatically).  This is because prior to returning, each recursion layer properly frees any extra deref
	// buffer it was responsible for creating.  It only has to free at most one such buffer because each layer of
	// ExpandArgs() on the call-stack can never be blamed for creating more than one extra buffer.
