// v1.0.40.02: This is now a separate file to allow its compiler optimization settings
// to be set independently of those of the other modules.  In one benchmark, this
// improved performance of expressions and function calls by 9% (that is, when the
// other modules are set to "minimize size" such as for the AutoHotkeySC.bin file).
// This gain in performance is at the cost of a 1.5 KB increase in the size of the
// compressed code, which seems well worth it given how often expressions and
// function-calls are used (such as in loops).
//
// ExpandArgs() and related functions were also put into this file because that
// further improves performance across the board -- even for AutoHotkey.exe despite
// the fact that the only thing that changed for it was the module move, not the
// compiler settings.  Apparently, the butterfly effect can cause even minor
// modifications to impact the overall performance of the generated code by as much as
// 7%.  However, this might have more to do with cache hits and misses in the CPU than
// with the nature of the code produced by the compiler.
// UPDATE 10/18/2006: There's not much difference anymore -- in fact, using min size
// for everything makes compiled scripts slightly faster in basic benchmarks, probably
// due to the recent addition of the linker optimization that physically orders
// functions in a better order inside the EXE.  Therefore, script_expression.cpp no
// longer has a separate "favor fast code" option.

	// As of v1.0.31, there can be multiple deref buffers simultaneously if one or more called functions
	// requires a deref buffer of its own (separate from ours).  In addition, if a called function is
	// interrupted by a new thread before it finishes, the interrupting thread will also use the
	// new/separate deref buffer.  To minimize the amount of memory used in such cases,
	// each line containing one or more expression with one or more function call (rather than each
	// function call) will get up to one deref buffer of its own (i.e. only if its function body contains
	// commands that actually require a second deref buffer).  This is achieved by saving sDerefBuf's
	// pointer and setting sDerefBuf to NULL, which effectively makes the original deref buffer private
	// until the line that contains the function-calling expressions finishes completely.
	// Description of recursion and usage of multiple deref buffers:
	// 1) ExpandArgs() receives a line with one or more expressions containing one or more calls to user functions.
	// 2) Worst-case: those function-calls create a new sDerefBuf automatically via us having set sDerefBuf to NULL.
	// 3) Even worse, the bodies of those functions call other functions, which ExpandArgs() receives, resulting in
	//    a recursive leap back to step #1.
	// So the above shows how any number of new deref buffers can be created.  But that's okay as long as the
	// recursion collapses in an orderly manner (or the program exits, in which case the OS frees all its memory
	// automatically).  This is because prior to returning, each recursion layer properly frees any extra deref
	// buffer it was responsible for creating.  It only has to free at most one such buffer because each layer of
	// ExpandArgs() on the call-stack can never be blamed for creating more than one extra buffer.
	// Must always restore the original buffer (if there was one), not keep the new one, because our
	// caller needs the arg_deref addresses, which point into the original buffer.
	DEPRIVATIZE_S_DEREF_BUF;

	// For v1.0.31, this is no done right before returning so that any script function calls
	// made by our calls to ExpandExpression() will now be done.  There might still be layers
	// of ExpandArgs() beneath us on the call-stack, which is okay since they will keep the
	// largest of the two available deref bufs (as described above) and thus they should
	// reset the timer below right before they collapse/return.  
	// (Re)set the timer unconditionally so that it starts counting again from time zero.
	// In other words, we only want the timer to fire when the large deref buffer has been
	// unused/idle for a straight 10 seconds.  There is no danger of this timer freeing
	// the deref buffer at a critical moment because:
	// 1) The timer is reset with each call to ExpandArgs (this function);
	// 2) If our ExpandArgs() recursion layer takes a long time to finish, messages
	//    won't be checked and thus the timer can't fire because it relies on the msg loop.
	// 3) If our ExpandArgs() recursion layer launches function-calls in ExpandExpression(),
	//    those calls will call ExpandArgs() recursively and reset the timer if its
	//    buffer (not necessarily the original buffer somewhere on the call-stack) is large
	//    enough.  In light of this, there is a chance that the timer might execute and free
	//    a deref buffer other than the one it was originally intended for.  But in real world
	//    scenarios, that seems rare.  In addition, the consequences seem to be limited to
	//    some slight memory inefficiency.
	// It could be argued that the timer should only be activated when a hypothetical static
	// var sLayers that we maintain here indicates that we're the only layer.  However, if that
	// were done and the launch of a script function creates (directly or through thread
	// interruption, indirectly) a large deref buffer, and that thread is waiting for something
	// such as WinWait, that large deref buffer would never get freed.
