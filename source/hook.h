// UPDATE to the below comment: After a careful review, it seems best to buffer a user's selection of
// a custom menu item if the current quasi-thread is uninterruptible.  This is exactly the same way
// hotkeys are buffered.  By making a thread truly uninterruptible, behavior is more consistent with
// what most users would want, though it should be noted that this also makes it impossible for the
// OnExit subroutine to be interrupted by a custom menu item, even one that is designed to simply
// exit the script (by means of aborting the on-exit subroutine).  Another reason to buffer the
// selection of a custom menu item is that we don't want to interrupt the current thread if is
// right in the middle of executing a single line, e.g. doing something with the deref buffer
// (during which time an interruption might destroy the buffer's contents) or trying to open the
// clipboard or save data to it.  This particular weakness may be resolved when/if a dedicated
// thread is created to maintain the hook(s), thus allowing critical operations such as opening
// the clipboard to use a true Sleep() rather than MsgSleep().
// Since WM_COMMNOTIFY is never generated by the Win32 API, and since we want AHK_USER_MENU to be
// an ID less than WM_HOTKEY so that it doesn't get filtered out when the script is uninterruptible,
// the following trick is used to map our user-defined messages onto WM_COMMNOTIFY by sacrificing the
// wParam part of the message (using it as an indicator of what the message really is).
// Another reserved msg that might be fairly safe is WM_MDIICONARRANGE, but it's far less preferable:
#define TRANSLATE_AHK_MSG(msg, wparam) \
	if (msg == WM_COMMNOTIFY)\
	{\
		msg = (UINT)wparam;\
		wparam = 0;\
	} // In the above, wparam is made zero to help catch bugs.

// And these macros are kept here so that all this trickery is centrally located and thus more maintainable:
#define ASK_INSTANCE_TO_CLOSE(hwnd, reason) PostMessage(hwnd, WM_COMMNOTIFY, reason, 0);

// POST_AHK_USER_MENU: A gui_hwnd value != 0 is passed with the message if it came from a GUI's menu bar.
// This is done because it's good way to pass the info, but also so that its value will be in sync with the
// timestamp of the message (in case the message is stuck in the queue for a long time).  No pointer is
// passed in this case since they might become invalid between the time the msg is posted vs. processed.
#define POST_AHK_USER_MENU(hwnd, menu, gui_hwnd) PostMessage(hwnd, AHK_USER_MENU, gui_hwnd, menu);
#define POST_AHK_GUI_ACTION(hwnd, control_index, gui_event, event_info) PostMessage(hwnd, AHK_GUI_ACTION \
	, (WPARAM)(((control_index) << 16) | (gui_event)), (LPARAM)(event_info)); // Caller must ensure that gui_event is less than 0xFFFF.
// POST_AHK_DIALOG:
// Post a special msg that will attempt to force it to the foreground after it has been displayed,
// since the dialog often will flash in the task bar instead of becoming foreground.
// It's enough just to queue up a single message that dialog's message pump will forward to our
// main window proc once the dialog window has been displayed.  This avoids the overhead of creating
// and destroying the timer (although the timer may be needed anyway if any timed subroutines are
// enabled).  My only concern about this is that on some OS's, or on slower CPUs, the message may be
// received too soon (before the dialog window actually exists) resulting in our window proc not
// being able to ensure that it's the foreground window.  That seems unlikely, however, since
// MessageBox() and the other dialog invocating API calls (for FileSelectFile/Folder) likely
// ensures its window really exists before dispatching messages.

// Some reasoning behind the below data structures: Could build a new array for [sc][sc] and [vk][vk]
// (since only two keys are allowed in a ModifierVK/SC combination, only 2 dimensions are needed).
// But this would be a 512x512 array of shorts just for the SC part, which is 512K.  Instead, what we
// do is check whenever a key comes in: if it's a suffix and if a non-standard modifier key of any kind
// is currently down: consider action.  Most of the time, an action be found because the user isn't
// likely to be holding down a ModifierVK/SC, while pressing another key, unless it's modifying that key.
// Nor is he likely to have more than one ModifierVK/SC held down at a time.  It's still somewhat
// inefficient because have to look up the right prefix in a loop.  But most suffixes probably won't
// have more than one ModifierVK/SC anyway, so the lookup will usually find a match on the first
// iteration.
