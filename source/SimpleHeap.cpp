	// than 8 KB of additional memory (as shown by temporarily making BLOCK_SIZE a smaller value such as 8 KB
	// for a more accurate measurement).  That cost seems well worth the following benefits:
	// 1) Solves failure of API functions like GetRawInputDeviceList() when passed a non-aligned address.
	// 2) May solve other obscure issues (past and future), which improves sanity due to not chasing bugs
