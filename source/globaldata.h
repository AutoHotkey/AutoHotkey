// 9 might be better than 10 because if the granularity/timer is a little
// off on certain systems, a Sleep(10) might really result in a Sleep(20),
// whereas a Sleep(9) is almost certainly a Sleep(10) on OS's such as
// NT/2k/XP.  UPDATE: Roundoff issues with scripts having
// even multiples of 10 in them, such as "Sleep,300", shouldn't be hurt
// by this because they use GetTickCount() to verify how long the
// sleep duration actually was.  UPDATE again: Decided to go back to 10
// because I'm pretty confident that that always sleeps 10 on NT/2k/XP
// unless the system is under load, in which case any Sleep between 0
// and 20 inclusive seems to sleep for exactly(?) one timeslice.
// A timeslice appears to be 20ms in duration.  Anyway, using 10
// allows "SetKeyDelay, 10" to be really 10 rather than getting
// rounded up to 20 due to doing first a Sleep(10) and then a Sleep(1).
// For now, I'm avoiding using timeBeginPeriod to improve the resolution
// of Sleep() because of possible incompatibilities on some systems,
// and also because it may degrade overall system performance.
// UPDATE: Will get rounded up to 10 anyway by SetTimer().  However,
// future OSs might support timer intervals of less than 10.

// v1.0.39 for above: Apparently, one of the few times SetTimer fails is after the thread has done
// PostQuitMessage. That particular failure was causing an unwanted recursive call to ExitApp(),
// which is why the above no longer calls ExitApp on failure.  Here's the sequence:
// Someone called ExitApp (such as the max-hotkeys-per-interval warning dialog).
// ExitApp() removes the hooks.
// The hook-removal function calls MsgSleep() while waiting for the hook-thread to finish.
// MsgSleep attempts to set the main timer so that it can judge how long to wait.
// The timer fails and calls ExitApp even though a previous call to ExitApp is currently underway.

// See AutoExecSectionTimeout() for why g->AllowThreadToBeInterrupted is used rather than the other var.
// The below also sets g->ThreadStartTime and g->UninterruptibleDuration.  Notes about this:
// In case the AutoExecute section takes a long time (or never completes), allow interruptions
// such as hotkeys and timed subroutines after a short time. Use g->AllowThreadToBeInterrupted
// vs. g_AllowInterruption in case commands in the AutoExecute section need exclusive use of
// g_AllowInterruption (i.e. they might change its value to false and then back to true,
// which would interfere with our use of that var).
// From MSDN: "When you specify a TimerProc callback function, the default window procedure calls the
// callback function when it processes WM_TIMER. Therefore, you need to dispatch messages in the calling thread,
// even when you use TimerProc instead of processing WM_TIMER."  My: This is why all TimerProc type timers
// should probably have an associated window rather than passing NULL as first param of SetTimer().
//
// UPDATE v1.0.48: g->ThreadStartTime and g->UninterruptibleDuration were added so that IsInterruptible()
// won't make the AutoExec section interruptible prematurely.  In prior versions, KILL_AUTOEXEC_TIMER() did this,
// but with the new IsInterruptible() function, doing it in KILL_AUTOEXEC_TIMER() wouldn't be reliable because
// it might already have been done by IsInterruptible() [or vice versa], which might provide a window of
// opportunity in which any use of Critical by the AutoExec section would be undone by the second timeout.
// More info: Since AutoExecSection() never calls InitNewThread(), it never used to set the uninterruptible
// timer.  Instead, it had its own timer.  But now that IsInterruptible() checks for the timeout of
// "Thread Interrupt", AutoExec might become interruptible prematurely unless it uses the new method below.
