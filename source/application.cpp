bool MsgSleep(int aSleepDuration, MessageMode aMode)
// Returns true if it launched at least one thread, and false otherwise.

// time less than or equal to SLEEP_INTERVAL (i.e. the exact amount of the sleep
// isn't important to the caller).  This mode is provided for performance reasons
// (it avoids calls to GetTickCount and the TickCount math).  However, if the
// caller's script subroutine is suspended due to action by us, an unknowable
// amount of time may pass prior to finally returning to the caller.
{
	bool we_turned_on_defer = false; // Set default.
	if (aMode == RETURN_AFTER_MESSAGES_SPECIAL_FILTER)
	{
		aMode = RETURN_AFTER_MESSAGES; // To simplify things further below, eliminate the mode RETURN_AFTER_MESSAGES_SPECIAL_FILTER from further consideration.
		// g_DeferMessagesForUnderlyingPump is a global because the instance of MsgSleep on the call stack
		// that set it to true could launch new thread(s) that call MsgSleep again (i.e. a new layer), and a global
		// is the easiest way to inform all such MsgSleeps that there's a non-standard msg pump beneath them on the
		// call stack.
		if (!g_DeferMessagesForUnderlyingPump)
		{
			g_DeferMessagesForUnderlyingPump = true;
			we_turned_on_defer = true;

	}

	// The following is done here for performance reasons.  UPDATE: This probably never needs
	// to close the clipboard now that Line::ExecUntil() also calls CLOSE_CLIPBOARD_IF_OPEN:
	CLOSE_CLIPBOARD_IF_OPEN;

	// While in mode RETURN_AFTER_MESSAGES, there are different things that can happen:
	// 1) We launch a new hotkey subroutine, interrupting/suspending the old one.  But
	//    subroutine calls this function again, so now it's recursed.  And thus the
	//    new subroutine can be interrupted yet again.
	// 2) We launch a new hotkey subroutine, but it returns before any recursed call
	//    to this function discovers yet another hotkey waiting in the queue.  In this
	//    case, this instance/recursion layer of the function should process the
	//    hotkey messages linearly rather than recursively?  No, this doesn't seem
	//    necessary, because we can just return from our instance/layer and let the
	//    caller handle any messages waiting in the queue.  Eventually, the queue
	//    should be emptied, especially since most hotkey subroutines will run
	//    much faster than the user could press another hotkey, with the possible
	//    exception of the key-repeat feature triggered by holding a key down.
	//    Even in that case, the worst that would happen is that messages would
	//    get dropped off the queue because they're too old (I think that's what
	//    happens).
	// Based on the above, when mode is RETURN_AFTER_MESSAGES, we process
	// all messages until a hotkey message is encountered, at which time we
	// launch that subroutine only and then return when it returns to us, letting
	// the caller handle any additional messages waiting on the queue.  This avoids
	// the need to have a "run the hotkeys linearly" mode in a single iteration/layer
	// of this function.  Note: The WM_QUIT message does not receive any higher
	// precedence in the queue than other messages.  Thus, if there's ever concern
	// that that message would be lost, as a future change perhaps can use PeekMessage()
	// with a filter to explicitly check to see if our queue has a WM_QUIT in it
	// somewhere, prior to processing any messages that might take result in
	// a long delay before the remainder of the queue items are processed (there probably
	// aren't any such conditions now, so nothing to worry about?)

	// Above is somewhat out-of-date.  The objective now is to spend as much time
	// inside GetMessage() as possible, since it's the keystroke/mouse engine
	// whenever the hooks are installed.  Any time we're not in GetMessage() for
	// any length of time (say, more than 20ms), keystrokes and mouse events
	// will be lagged.  PeekMessage() is probably almost as good, but it probably
	// only clears out any waiting keys prior to returning.  CONFIRMED: PeekMessage()
	// definitely routes to the hook, perhaps only if called regularly (i.e. a single
	// isolated call might not help much).

	// This var allows us to suspend the currently-running subroutine and run any
	// hotkey events waiting in the message queue (if there are more than one, they
	// will be executed in sequence prior to resuming the suspended subroutine).
	// Never static because we could be recursed (e.g. when one hotkey interrupts
	// a hotkey that has already been interrupted) and each recursion layer should
	// have it's own value for this:
	TCHAR ErrorLevel_saved[ERRORLEVEL_SAVED_SIZE];

	// Decided to support a true Sleep(0) for aSleepDuration == 0, as well
	// as no delay at all if aSleepDuration < 0.  This is needed to implement
	// "SetKeyDelay, 0" and possibly other things.  I believe a Sleep(0)
	// is always <= Sleep(1) because both of these will wind up waiting
	// a full timeslice if the CPU is busy.

	// Reminder for anyone maintaining or revising this code:
	// Giving each subroutine its own thread rather than suspending old ones is
	// probably not a good idea due to the exclusive nature of the GUI
	// (i.e. it's probably better to suspend existing subroutines rather than
	// letting them continue to run because they might activate windows and do
	// other stuff that would interfere with the window automation activities of
	// other threads)

	// If caller didn't specify, the exact amount of the Sleep() isn't
	// critical to it, only that we handles messages and do Sleep()
	// a little.
	// Most of this initialization section isn't needed if aMode == WAIT_FOR_MESSAGES,
	// but it's done anyway for consistency:
	bool allow_early_return;
	if (aSleepDuration == INTERVAL_UNSPECIFIED)
	{
		aSleepDuration = SLEEP_INTERVAL;  // Set interval to be the default length.
		allow_early_return = true;
	}
	else
		// The timer resolution makes waiting for half or less of an
		// interval too chancy.  The correct thing to do on average
		// is some kind of rounding, which this helps with:
		allow_early_return = (aSleepDuration <= SLEEP_INTERVAL_HALF);

	// Record the start time when the caller first called us so we can keep
	// track of how much time remains to sleep (in case the caller's subroutine
	// is suspended until a new subroutine is finished).  But for small sleep
	// intervals, don't worry about it.
	// Note: QueryPerformanceCounter() has very high overhead compared to GetTickCount():
	DWORD start_time = allow_early_return ? 0 : GetTickCount();

	// This check is also done even if the main timer will be set (below) so that
	// an initial check is done rather than waiting 10ms more for the first timer
	// message to come in.  Some of our many callers would want this, and although some
	// would not need it, there are so many callers that it seems best to just do it
	// unconditionally, especially since it's not a high overhead call (e.g. it returns
	// immediately if the tickcount is still the same as when it was last run).
	// Another reason for doing this check immediately is that our msg queue might
	// contains a time-consuming msg prior to our WM_TIMER msg, e.g. a hotkey msg.
	// In that case, the hotkey would be processed and launched without us first having
	// emptied the queue to discover the WM_TIMER msg.  In other words, WM_TIMER msgs
	// might get buried in the queue behind others, so doing this check here should help
	// ensure that timed subroutines are checked often enough to keep them running at
	// their specified frequencies.
	// Note that ExecUntil() no longer needs to call us solely for prevention of lag
	// caused by the keyboard & mouse hooks, so checking the timers early, rather than
	// immediately going into the GetMessage() state, should not be a problem:
	POLL_JOYSTICK_IF_NEEDED  // Do this first since it's much faster.
	bool return_value = false; //  Set default.  Also, this is used by the macro below.
	CHECK_SCRIPT_TIMERS_IF_NEEDED

	// Because this function is called recursively: for now, no attempt is
	// made to improve performance by setting the timer interval to be
	// aSleepDuration rather than a standard short interval.  That would cause
	// a problem if this instance of the function invoked a new subroutine,
	// suspending the one that called this instance.  The new subroutine
	// might need a timer of a longer interval, which would mess up
	// this layer.  One solution worth investigating is to give every
	// layer/instance its own timer (the ID of the timer can be determined
	// from info in the WM_TIMER message).  But that can be a real mess
	// because what if a deeper recursion level receives our first
	// WM_TIMER message because we were suspended too long?  Perhaps in
	// that case we wouldn't our WM_TIMER pulse because upon returning
	// from those deeper layers, we would check to see if the current
	// time is beyond our finish time.  In addition, having more timers
	// might be worse for overall system performance than having a single
	// timer that pulses very frequently (because the system must keep
	// them all up-to-date).  UPDATE: Timer is now also needed whenever an
	// aSleepDuration greater than 0 is about to be done and there are some
	// script timers that need to be watched (this happens when aMode == WAIT_FOR_MESSAGES).
	// UPDATE: Make this a macro so that it is dynamically resolved every time, in case
	// the value of g_script.mTimerEnabledCount changes on-the-fly.
	// UPDATE #2: The below has been changed in light of the fact that the main timer is
	// now kept always-on whenever there is at least one enabled timed subroutine.
	// This policy simplifies ExecUntil() and long-running commands such as FileSetAttrib.
	// UPDATE #3: Use aMode == RETURN_AFTER_MESSAGES, not g_nThreads > 0, because the
	// "Edit This Script" menu item (and possibly other places) might result in an indirect
	// call to us and we will need the timer to avoid getting stuck in the GetMessageState()
	// with hotkeys being disallowed due to filtering:
	bool this_layer_needs_timer = (aSleepDuration > 0 && aMode == RETURN_AFTER_MESSAGES);
	if (this_layer_needs_timer)
	{
		++g_nLayersNeedingTimer;  // IsCycleComplete() is responsible for decrementing this for us.
		SET_MAIN_TIMER
		// Reasons why the timer might already have been on:
		// 1) g_script.mTimerEnabledCount is greater than zero or there are joystick hotkeys.
		// 2) another instance of MsgSleep() (beneath us in the stack) needs it (see the comments

				// - The hook avoids doing its first check of WinActive/Exist if it sees that the hotkey
				//   has a non-suspended, global variant.  That way, hotkeys that are hook-hotkeys for
				//   reasons other than #IfWin (such as mouse, overriding OS hotkeys, or hotkeys
				//   that are too fancy for RegisterHotkey) will not have to do the check twice.
				// - It provides the ability to set the last-found-window for #IfWinActive/Exist
				//   (though it's not needed for the "Not" counterparts).  This HWND could be passed
				//   via the message, but that would require malloc-there and free-here, and might
				//   result in memory leaks if its ever possible for messages to get discarded by the OS.
				// - It allows hotkeys that were eligible for firing at the time the message was
				//   posted but that have since become ineligible to be aborted.  This seems like a
				//   good precaution for most users/situations because such hotkey subroutines will
				//   often assume (for scripting simplicity) that the specified window is active or
				//   exists when the subroutine executes its first line.
				// - Most criterion hotkeys use #IfWinActive, which is a very fast call.  Also, although

			// Peek-check completes, a long time might have passed, and the thread might now be interruptible
			// due to the interruptible-timer having expired (which is probably possible only in the no-yield
			// scenario above, since in the case of yield, ExecUntil wouldn't check messages again after the
			// yield).  Thus, the Peek-check's MsgSleep() might launch an interrupting thread before the prior
			// thread had a chance to execute even one line.  Resetting mLastPeekTime above should alleviate that,
			// perhaps even completely resolve it due to the way tickcounts tend not to change early on in
			// a timeslice (perhaps because timeslices fall exactly upon tick-count boundaries).  If it doesn't
			// completely resolve it, mLastPeekTime could instead be set to zero as a special value that
			// ExecUntil recognizes to do the following processing, but this processing reduces performance

	// Below are the reasons for having g->UninterruptibleDuration as a field separate from g->ThreadStartTime
	// (i.e. this is why they aren't merged into one called TimeThreadWillBecomeInterruptible):
	// (1) Need some way of indicating "never time out", which is currently done via
	//     UninterruptibleDuration<0. Although that could be done as a bool to reduce global_struct size,
	//     there's also the below.
	// (2) Suspending or hibernating the computer while a thread is uninterruptible could cause the thread to
	//    become semi-permanently uninterruptible.  For example:
	//     - If a thread's uninterruptibility timeout is 60 seconds (or even 60 milliseconds);
	//     - And the computer is suspended/hibernated before the uninterruptibility can time out;
	//     - And the computer is then resumed 25 days later;
	//     - Thread would be wrongly uninterruptible for ~24 days because the single-field method
	//       (TimeThreadWillBecomeInterruptible) would have to subtract that field from GetTickCount()
	//       and view the result as a signed integer.
	// (3) Somewhat similar to #2 above, there may be ways now or in the future for a script to have an
	//     active/current thread but nothing the script does ever requires a call to IsInterruptible()
	//     (currently unlikely since MSG_FILTER_MAX calls it).  This could cause a TickCount to get too
	//     stale and have the same consequences as described in #2 above.
	// OVERALL: Although the method used here can wrongly extend the uninterruptibility of a thread by as
	// much as 100%, since g_script.mUninterruptible time defaults to 15 milliseconds (and in practice is
	// rarely raised beyond 1000) it doesn't matter much in those cases. Even when g_script.mUninterruptible
	// is large such as 20 days, this method can be off by no more than 20 days, which isn't too bad
	// in percentage terms compared to the alternative, which could cause a timeout of 15 milliseconds to
	// increase to 24 days.  Windows Vista and beyond have a 64-bit tickcount available, so that may be of
	// use in future versions (hopefully it performs nearly as well as GetTickCount()).
