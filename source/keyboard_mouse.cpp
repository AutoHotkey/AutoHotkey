// becomes a persistent modifier (e.g. via Send {LWin down}) and the user physically
// releases LWin immediately before: 1) the {LWin up} is scheduled; and 2) SendKey()
// returns.  Then SendKey() will push the modifier back down so that it is in effect
// for other things done by its caller (SendKeys) and also so that if the Send
// operation ends, the key will still be down as the user intended (to modify future
// keystrokes, physical or simulated).  However, since that down-event is followed
// immediately by an up-event, the Start Menu appears for WIN-key or the active
// window's menu bar is activated for ALT-key.  SOLUTION: Disguise Win-up and Alt-up
// events in these cases.  This workaround has been successfully tested.  It's also
// limited is scope so that a script can still explicitly invoke the Start Menu with
// "Send {LWin}", or activate the menu bar with "Send {Alt}".
// The check of sPrevEventModifierDown allows "Send {LWinDown}{LWinUp}" etc., to
// continue to work.

			// 3) Changes made to modifier state by SendPlay are seen only by the active window's thread.
			//    Thus, it would be inconsistent and possibly incorrect to adjust global modifier state
			//    after (or during) a SendPlay.
			// So rather than resorting to #HotkeyModifierTimeout, we can restore the modifiers within the
			// protection of SendInput/Play's uninterruptibility, allowing the user's buffered keystrokes
			// (if any) to hit against the correct modifier state when the SendInput/Play completes.
			// For example, if #c:: is a hotkey and the user releases Win during the SendInput/Play, that
			// release would hit after SendInput/Play restores Win to the down position, and thus Win would
			// not be stuck down.  Furthermore, if the user didn't release Win, Win would be in the
			// correct/intended position.
			// This approach has a few weaknesses (but the strengths appear to outweigh them):
			// 1) Hitting SendInput's 5000 char limit would omit the tail-end keystrokes, which would mess up
			//    all the assumptions here.  But hitting that limit should be very rare, especially since it's
			//    documented and thus scripts will avoid it.
			// 2) SendInput's assumed uninterruptibility is false if any other app or script has an LL hook
			//    installed.  This too is documented, so scripts should generally avoid using SendInput when
			//    they know there are other LL hooks in the system.  In any case, there's no known solution

			// The problems came about from the following sequence of events:
			// 1) Script simulates a left-click-down in the title bar's close, minimize, or maximize button.
			// 2) WM_NCLBUTTONDOWN is sent to the window's window proc, which then passes it on to
			//    DefWindowProc or DefDlgProc, which then apparently enters a loop in which no messages
			//    (or a very limited subset) are pumped.
			// 3) Thus, if the user presses a hotkey while the thread is in this state, that hotkey is
			//    queued/buffered until DefWindowProc/DefDlgProc exits its loop.
			// 4) But the buffered hotkey is the very thing that's supposed to exit the loop via sending a
			//    simulated left-click-up event.
			// 5) Thus, a deadlock occurs.
			// 6) A similar situation arises when a right-click-down is sent to the title bar or sys-menu-icon.
			//
			// The following workaround operates by suppressing qualified click-down events until the
			// corresponding click-up occurs, at which time the click-up is transformed into a down+up if the
			// click-up is still in the same cursor position as the down. It seems preferable to fix this here
			// rather than changing each window proc. to always respond to click-down rather vs. click-up
			// because that would make all of the script's windows behave in a non-standard way, possibly
			// producing side-effects and defeating other programs' attempts to interact with them.
			// (Thanks to Shimanov for this solution.)
			//
			// Remaining known limitations:
			// 1) Title bar buttons are not visibly in a pressed down state when a simulated click-down is sent
			//    to them.
			// 2) A window that should not be activated, such as AlwaysOnTop+Disabled, is activated anyway
			//    by SetForegroundWindowEx().  Not yet fixed due to its rarity and minimal consequences.
			// 3) A related problem for which no solution has been discovered (and perhaps it's too obscure
			//    an issue to justify any added code size): If a remapping such as "F1::LButton" is in effect,
			//    pressing and releasing F1 while the cursor is over a script window's title bar will cause the
			//    window to move slightly the next time the mouse is moved.
			// 4) Clicking one of the script's window's title bar with a key/button that has been remapped to
			//    become the left mouse button sometimes causes the button to get stuck down from the window's
			//    point of view.  The reasons are related to those in #1 above.  In both #1 and #2, the workaround
			//    is not at fault because it's not in effect then.  Instead, the issue is that DefWindowProc enters
			//    a non-msg-pumping loop while it waits for the user to drag-move the window.  If instead the user
			//    releases the button without dragging, the loop exits on its own after a 500ms delay or so.
			// 5) Obscure behavior caused by keyboard's auto-repeat feature: Use a key that's been remapped to
			//    become the left mouse button to click and hold the minimize button of one of the script's windows.
			//    Drag to the left.  The window starts moving.  This is caused by the fact that the down-click is
			//    suppressed, thus the remap's hotkey subroutine thinks the mouse button is down, thus its
			//    auto-repeat suppression doesn't work and it sends another click.

	// Notes about modifier key behavior on Windows XP (these probably apply to NT/2k also, and has also
	// been tested to be true on Win98): The WIN and ALT keys are the problem keys, because if either is
	// released without having modified something (even another modifier), the WIN key will cause the
	// Start Menu to appear, and the ALT key will activate the menu bar of the active window (if it has one).
	// For example, a hook hotkey such as "$#c::Send text" (text must start with a lowercase letter
	// to reproduce the issue, because otherwise WIN would be auto-disguised as a side effect of the SHIFT
	// keystroke) would cause the Start Menu to appear if the disguise method below weren't used.
	//
	// Here are more comments formerly in SetModifierLRStateSpecific(), which has since been eliminated
	// because this function is sufficient:
	// To prevent it from activating the menu bar, the release of the ALT key should be disguised
	// unless a CTRL key is currently down.  This is because CTRL always seems to avoid the
	// activation of the menu bar (unlike SHIFT, which sometimes allows the menu to be activated,
	// though this is hard to reproduce on XP).  Another reason not to use SHIFT is that the OS
	// uses LAlt+Shift as a hotkey to switch languages.  Such a hotkey would be triggered if SHIFT
	// were pressed down to disguise the release of LALT.
	//
	// Alt-down events are also disguised whenever they won't be accompanied by a Ctrl-down.
	// This is necessary whenever our caller does not plan to disguise the key itself.  For example,
	// if "!a::Send Test" is a registered hotkey, two things must be done to avoid complications:
	// 1) Prior to sending the word test, ALT must be released in a way that does not activate the
	//    menu bar.  This is done by sandwiching it between a CTRL-down and a CTRL-up.
	// 2) After the send is complete, SendKeys() will restore the ALT key to the down position if
	//    the user is still physically holding ALT down (this is done to make the logical state of
	//    the key match its physical state, which allows the same hotkey to be fired twice in a row
	//    without the user having to release and press down the ALT key physically).
	// The #2 case above is the one handled below by ctrl_wont_be_down.  It is especially necessary
	// when the user releases the ALT key prior to releasing the hotkey suffix, which would otherwise
	// cause the menu bar (if any) of the active window to be activated.
	//
	// Some of the same comments above for ALT key apply to the WIN key.  More about this issue:
	// Although the disguise of the down-event is usually not needed, it is needed in the rare case
	// where the user releases the WIN or ALT key prior to releasing the hotkey's suffix.
	// Although the hook could be told to disguise the physical release of ALT or WIN in these
	// cases, it's best not to rely on the hook since it is not always installed.
	//
	// Registered WIN and ALT hotkeys that don't use the Send command work okay except ALT hotkeys,
	// which if the user releases ALT prior the hotkey's suffix key, cause the menu bar to be activated.

		// the case.  MSDN doesn't spell this out, but testing shows that what happens with a low-level
		// hook is that the moment a keystroke comes into a thread (either physical or simulated), the OS
		// immediately calls something similar to SendMessage() from that thread to notify the hook
		// thread that a keystroke has arrived.  However, if the hook thread's priority is lower than
		// some other thread next in line for a timeslice, it might take some time for the hook thread
		// to get a timeslice (that's why the hook thread is given a high priority).
		// The SendMessage() call doesn't return until its timeout expires (as set in the registry for
		// hooks) or the hook thread processes the keystroke (which requires that it call something like
		// GetMessage/PeekMessage followed by a HookProc "return").  This is good news because it serializes
		// keyboard and mouse input to make the presence of the hook transparent to other threads (unless
		// the hook does something to reveal itself, such as suppressing keystrokes). Serialization avoids
		// any chance of synchronization problems such as a program that changes the state of a key then
		// immediately checks the state of that same key via GetAsyncKeyState().  Another way to look at
		// all of this is that in essence, a single-threaded hook program that simulates keystrokes or
		// mouse clicks should behave the same when the hook is moved into a separate thread because from
		// the program's point-of-view, keystrokes & mouse clicks result in a calling the hook almost

	// *both* alt+ctrl?
	// Release alt and both controls before going down on lshift/rshift.
	// Rather than the below, do the above (for the reason below).
	// But if do this, don't want to prevent a legit/intentional language switch such as:
	//    Send {LAlt down}{Shift}{LAlt up}.
	// If both Alt and Shift are down, Win or Ctrl (or any other key for that matter) must be pressed before either
	// is released.
	// If both Ctrl and Shift are down, Win or Alt (or any other key) must be pressed before either is released.
	// remind: Despite what the Regional Settings window says, RAlt+Shift (and Shift+RAlt) is also a language hotkey (i.e. not just LAlt), at least when RAlt isn't AltGr!
	// remind: Control being down suppresses language switch only once.  After that, control being down doesn't help if lalt is re-pressed prior to re-pressing shift.
	//
	// Language switch occurs when:
	// alt+shift (upon release of shift)
	// shift+alt (upon release of lalt)
	// ctrl+shift (upon release of shift)
	// shift+ctrl (upon release of ctrl)
	// Because language hotkey only takes effect upon release of Shift, it can be disguised via a Control keystroke if that is ever needed.

	// NOTES: More details about disguising ALT and WIN:
	// Registered Alt hotkeys don't quite work if the Alt key is released prior to the suffix.
	// Key history for Alt-B hotkey released this way, which undesirably activates the menu bar:
	// A4  038	 	d	0.03	Alt            	
	// 42  030	 	d	0.03	B              	
	// A4  038	 	u	0.24	Alt            	
	// 42  030	 	u	0.19	B              	
	// Testing shows that the above does not happen for a normal (non-hotkey) alt keystroke such as Alt-8,
	// so the above behavior is probably caused by the fact that B-down is suppressed by the OS's hotkey
	// routine, but not B-up.
	// The above also happens with registered WIN hotkeys, but only if the Send cmd resulted in the WIN
	// modifier being pushed back down afterward to match the fact that the user is still holding it down.
	// This behavior applies to ALT hotkeys also.
	// One solution: if the hook is installed, have it keep track of when the start menu or menu bar
	// *would* be activated.  These tracking vars can be consulted by the Send command, and the hook
	// can also be told when to use them after a registered hotkey has been pressed, so that the Alt-up
	// or Win-up keystroke that belongs to it can be disguised.

	// The following are important ways in which other methods of disguise might not be sufficient:
	// Sequence: shift-down win-down shift-up win-up: invokes Start Menu when WIN is held down long enough
	// to auto-repeat.  Same when Ctrl or Alt is used in lieu of Shift.
	// Sequence: shift-down alt-down alt-up shift-up: invokes menu bar.  However, as long as another key,
	// even Shift, is pressed down *after* alt is pressed down, menu bar is not activated, e.g. alt-down
	// shift-down shift-up alt-up.  In addition, CTRL always prevents ALT from activating the menu bar,
	// even with the following sequences:
	// ctrl-down alt-down alt-up ctrl-up
	// alt-down ctrl-down ctrl-up alt-up
	// (also seems true for all other permutations of Ctrl/Alt)
